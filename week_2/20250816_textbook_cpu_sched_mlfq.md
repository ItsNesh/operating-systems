# Comprehensive Study Notes: Multi-Level Feedback Queue (MLFQ) Scheduling  
*Based on OSTEP Chapter "Scheduling: The Multi-Level Feedback Queue"*

---

## **I. Introduction & Historical Context**  

### **Core Problem Addressed by MLFQ**
- **Dual Optimization Challenge**:  
  - Optimize *turnaround time* (short jobs first, like SJF/STCF) → Requires knowing job length upfront.
  - Minimize *response time for interactive users* (like Round Robin) → But RR harms turnaround time.  
  > 💡 **The Crucial Question**: *"How can we schedule without perfect knowledge of job characteristics?"*

- **MLFQ's Approach**: Learns from past behavior to predict future needs, avoiding the need for prior knowledge.

### **Historical Significance**
| Contributor | Work                          | Impact                                                                 |
|-------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Corbato et al. (1962) | CTSS (Compatible Time-Sharing System) | First MLFQ implementation; led to Turing Award for Corbato.            |
| Later Refinements   | Multics OS                    | Evolved into foundational design principles in modern schedulers.       |

> 📌 **Key Insight**: MLFQ is a *learning system*—it adapts based on observed behavior (e.g., I/O patterns, CPU usage), similar to branch predictors or caching algorithms.

---

## **II. Core Principles of MLFQ**  
### **Fundamental Rules**
| Rule | Description                                                                 |
|------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Rule 1** | *Priority-Based Selection*: Higher priority job runs (e.g., Q2 > Q1).        |
| **Rule 2** | *Equal Priority Handling*: Jobs at same level use Round Robin with queue’s quantum. |

### **Key Concepts**
- **Queue Levels**: Multiple queues, each assigned a fixed priority (Q0 = lowest, Qn = highest).
- **Allotment**: Time limit a job can run at its current priority before demotion.
  - *Initial assumption*: Allotment = single time slice (quantum).  
- **Dynamic Priority Adjustment**: Priorities change based on observed behavior.

---

## **III. Initial MLFQ Design & Examples**  
### **Rules #3–#4a/b: Basic Behavior**
| Rule | Description                                                                 |
|------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Rule 3** | New jobs start at *highest priority queue* (e.g., Q2).                       |
| **Rule 4a** | Job uses full allotment → Demoted to next lower queue.                      |
| **Rule 4b** | Job relinquishes CPU early (I/O) → Allotment reset; stays in same queue.   |

### **Example 1: Long-Running CPU-Bound Job**
![Long-running job](https://i.imgur.com/8XJzZ9l.png)  
*Figure 8.2 from textbook*:  
- Time slice = allotment = **10 ms**.
- Job starts at Q2 (highest).
- After first time slice: Uses full allotment → Demoted to Q1.
- After second time slice: Demoted to Q0 (lowest), stays there forever.

> ✅ *Outcome*: Long jobs move down queues but never get CPU if interactive jobs dominate.

---

### **Example 2: Short Interactive Job Arrives During a Long Run**  
![Short job example](https://i.imgur.com/5kR7cPm.png)  
*Figure 8.3 (left)*:
- **Job A**: Long-running, CPU-bound → Already in Q0.
- **Job B**: Short interactive (20 ms run time), arrives at T=100.
- **Behavior**:
  - B enters Q2 (highest priority).
  - Runs for two time slices (20 ms total) without using full allotment per queue?  
    → *Actually, since it finishes before demotion*, stays in high queues.  
  - A resumes at low priority after B completes.

> 💡 **Why MLFQ Approximates SJF**: Assumes all jobs are short until proven otherwise (demotes if they use CPU long).

---

### **Example 3: I/O-Bound Interactive Job**  
![I/O example](https://i.imgur.com/4nJkD6d.png)  
*Figure 8.3 (right)*:
- **Job A**: Long-running batch job (black).
- **Job B**: Interactive job needing CPU for only **1 ms**, then does I/O.
- **Behavior**:
  - At T=50, B uses CPU for 1 ms → Relinquishes before allotment ends (Rule 4b) → Stays in Q2.
  - A runs during B’s I/O wait time.

> ✅ *Outcome*: Interactive jobs get quick response times; MLFQ correctly prioritizes them.

---

## **IV. Critical Flaws in Initial Design**  
### **Problem #1: Starvation**
- **Cause**: Too many interactive jobs consume all CPU → Long-running jobs never run.
  > ❌ Example: If only short jobs exist, long jobs starve forever (no Rule 5).

### **Problem #2: Gaming the Scheduler**
- **Attack Vector**:
  - Job runs for ~99% of allotment → Issues I/O to reset allotment → Stays in high queue.
  - *Result*: Monopolizes CPU (e.g., 99% share).
- **Why it works**: Rule 4b resets allotment on I/O, ignoring usage.

### **Problem #3: Inability to Adapt**
- If a job transitions from CPU-bound → interactive:
  - It remains in low queue until boosted.
  - *Result*: Interactive behavior not recognized immediately.

---

## **V. Refinements & Solutions**  
### **Attempt #2: Priority Boosting (Rule 5)**  
| Rule | Description                                                                 |
|------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Rule 5** | After time period **S**, move all jobs to *topmost queue* (Qn).             |

#### **How It Solves Flaws**
- ✅ **Prevents starvation**: All jobs get periodic high priority.
- ✅ **Adapts to behavior changes**: CPU-bound job becomes interactive → Boosted to top.

> ⚠️ **The "Voo-Doo Constant" S**:
> - Too large (e.g., 10s): Long jobs starve during peak interactive load.  
> - Too small (e.g., 1 ms): Interactive jobs get interrupted too often, harming responsiveness.
> - *Ousterhout’s Law*: "Avoid voo-doo constants" → S is tuned empirically or via ML.

#### **Example: With/Without Boost**  
![Priority boost example](https://i.imgur.com/VqXfGcP.png)  
*Figure 8.4 from textbook*:
- **Left (No Boost)**: Long job starves after short jobs arrive.
- **Right (Boost every 100 ms)**: Long job gets periodic CPU time.

---

### **Attempt #3: Better Accounting**  
#### **Revised Rule 4**:  
> *"Once a job uses up its allotment at any level (regardless of I/O), demote it."*  

| Old Rules | New Rule                                                                 |
|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Rule 4a/b | Reset allotment on I/O → Allows gaming.                                  |
| **Rule 4** | Track *total CPU time used per queue*, ignore I/O interruptions.         |

#### **Example: Preventing Gaming**  
![Gaming prevention](https://i.imgur.com/3RdJkYl.png)  
*Figure 8.5 from textbook*:
- **Left (Old Rules)**: Job uses 99% allotment → Does I/O → Stays in Q2, monopolizes CPU.
- **Right (New Rule)**: Same job must use full allotment across all time slices → Demoted to lower queue.

> ✅ *Outcome*: No gaming possible; fairer resource allocation.

## **VI. Tuning MLFQ Parameters**  
### **Key Configuration Choices**
| Parameter          | Typical Value               | Rationale                                                                 |
|--------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Number of Queues** | 60 (Solaris default)        | Balances granularity vs. overhead.                                        |
| **Time Slice per Queue** | Q2: 10 ms, Q1: 20 ms, Q0: 40+ ms | High-priority queues need short quanta for responsiveness; low priority = longer bursts for CPU-bound jobs. |
| **Boost Period (S)**   | ~1 second (Solaris)         | Empirically tuned to balance starvation and interactive fairness.          |

### **Real-World Implementations**
| System             | Implementation Detail                                                                 |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Solaris**        | *Time-Sharing class* (`TS`): 60 queues, time slices from 20 ms (top) → hundreds of ms (bottom), boost every ~1s. |
| **FreeBSD**        | Decay-usage formula: Priority = `f(CPU_usage)` + decay over time (no fixed queues). |
| **Windows NT**     | MLFQ variant with priority classes; user-adjustable via `nice` command.              |

### **Advanced Features**
1. **Reserved Priorities for OS Work**:  
   - Highest queue reserved for kernel tasks → User jobs never get top priority.
2. **User Advice (e.g., `nice`)**:  
   - Users can *suggest* priorities (`nice 5` lowers priority, `nice -5` raises it).  
   > 💡 **Ousterhout’s Law**: "OS rarely knows best for all processes → Provide advice interfaces."

## **VII. Summary of MLFQ Rules**  
| Rule | Description                                                                 |
|------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | Higher priority job runs (e.g., Q2 > Q1).                                   |
| 2    | Same priority: Round Robin with queue’s quantum.                            |
| 3    | New jobs start at *highest* priority queue.                                 |
| **4** | **Job uses full allotment → Demote to next lower queue** (ignores I/O).     |
| **5** | Periodically boost all jobs to topmost queue after time `S`.                |

> ✅ **Why MLFQ Wins**:  
> - *Short interactive jobs*: Run quickly at high priority.  
> - *Long CPU-bound jobs*: Demoted but get periodic boosts → Fair progress.  
> - *No prior knowledge needed* (learns from behavior).

## **VIII. Systems Using MLFQ**  
| System                | Scheduling Class/Implementation |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------|
| BSD UNIX derivatives  | `nice` + decay-usage scheduler ([LM+89]) |
| Solaris               | Time-Sharing (`TS`) class       |
| Windows NT            | Base scheduler (MLFQ variant)   |

> 🔍 **Why MLFQ Dominates**: It achieves *both* low response time for interactivity and good throughput for batch workloads.

## **IX. Comprehensive Study Questions**  
*(15-20 questions covering all concepts)*  

### **Conceptual Understanding**
1. Why does MLFQ avoid needing prior knowledge of job length? Explain using the "learning from history" principle.
2. How would you modify Rule 4b to prevent gaming *without* adding a new rule?
3. In what scenario would a long-running CPU-bound job become interactive, and how does MLFQ handle it after **Rule 5** is implemented?
4. Why do high-priority queues use short time slices (e.g., 10 ms), while low-priority queues use longer ones (e.g., 100+ ms)?
5. What happens if `S` in Rule 5 is set to *zero*? How does this affect system behavior?

### **Problem-Solving**
6. A job runs for 9 ms, then issues I/O at T=9ms (allotment = 10 ms). Under the initial MLFQ rules (Rule 4b), what happens next?
7. Given a 2-queue MLFQ with allotments: Q2=5ms, Q1=10ms:
   - Job A runs for 6 ms at Q2 → What queue does it move to?  
   - Job B arrives after A has run 3 ms; how long until B is demoted?
8. Calculate the minimum `S` (boost period) needed so a single CPU-bound job gets ≥5% of CPU with:
   - Quantum = 10 ms at top queue.
   - System runs only one interactive job + one CPU-bound job.

### **Critical Analysis**
9. Why is "voo-doo constant" S considered problematic? How does modern ML-based tuning (e.g., [A+17]) address this?
10. Explain how Rule 4 prevents gaming using the *allotment accounting* concept.
11. Describe a workload where **Rule 5** causes *worse* response time for interactive jobs than without boosting.

### **Real-World Application**
12. How would you configure MLFQ to behave exactly like Round Robin?
    - (Hint: All queues must have same priority; no demotion.)
13. Why might an OS reserve the highest queue for kernel work? Give a security example.
14. In Solaris, how does `nice` interact with Rule 5 and allotment tracking?

### **Advanced Scenarios**
15. A job transitions from CPU-bound (Q0) to interactive at T=200ms:
    - Without boosting: How long until it gets high priority?  
    - With boost every 1s: When does it get boosted?
16. Why is MLFQ *not* suitable for real-time systems requiring hard deadlines?

### **Exam-Style Questions**
17. *"MLFQ approximates SJF."* Justify this statement with reference to Example 2.
18. Contrast the goals of:
    - Round Robin (minimizes response time)
    - Shortest Job First (minimizes turnaround time)  
    How does MLFQ balance both?
19. Explain why **Rule 4** is a *single rule* replacing Rules 4a/4b.
20. If all jobs are I/O-bound, what happens to their priorities? Why?
