I'll create comprehensive study notes for the textbook chapter "Week 1 Introduction: Textbook CPU Mechanisms" based on the provided slides. I'll follow the instructions to create well-structured, comprehensive study notes in markdown format.

Let me analyze the content first to understand the key concepts:

The chapter is about CPU virtualization mechanisms, specifically "Limited Direct Execution" (LDE), which is a technique for operating systems to virtualize the CPU while maintaining control.

Key topics covered:
1. The need for CPU virtualization (sharing physical CPU among many processes)
2. Challenges: performance and control
3. Basic technique: Limited Direct Execution
4. Problem #1: Restricted Operations (system calls, user mode vs kernel mode)
5. Problem #2: Switching Between Processes (cooperative vs non-cooperative approaches, timer interrupts, context switches)

I'll organize the notes following the chapter structure, highlighting key concepts, definitions, and processes.

Let me create the study notes:

# Week 1: CPU Mechanisms - Limited Direct Execution

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the fundamental challenge of CPU virtualization: sharing the physical CPU among multiple processes while maintaining control
- Learn the concept of "Limited Direct Execution" as a mechanism for CPU virtualization
- Understand the role of hardware support (user mode vs kernel mode) in enabling secure system calls
- Learn how operating systems regain control of the CPU through timer interrupts
- Understand the context switch mechanism for process switching

## Core Challenge of CPU Virtualization

**THE CRUX: HOW TO EFFICIENTLY VIRTUALIZE THE CPU WITH CONTROL**

Operating systems must:
- Virtualize the CPU in an efficient manner (minimize overhead)
- Retain control over the system (prevent processes from monopolizing CPU or accessing restricted resources)

This requires both hardware and operating system support.

## 6.1 Basic Technique: Limited Direct Execution

### Concept
- **Direct Execution**: Run programs directly on the CPU (without virtualization)
- **Limited Direct Execution (LDE)**: Run programs directly but with restrictions to maintain OS control

### Why Limited?
Without limitations, the OS would be "just a library" - unable to control processes, leading to security and stability issues.

### Direct Execution Protocol (Without Limits)
1. Create entry for process in process list
2. Allocate memory for program
3. Load program into memory
4. Set up stack with argc/argv
5. Clear registers
6. Execute call to main()
7. Run main()
8. Execute return from main()
9. Free memory of process
10. Remove from process list

*Figure 6.1: Direct Execution Protocol (Without Limits)*

## 6.2 Problem #1: Restricted Operations

### The Challenge
How can a process perform restricted operations (I/O, resource access) without giving it complete control over the system?

### Solution: Hardware Modes of Execution

| Mode | Permissions | Description |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| **User Mode** | Restricted | Code running here cannot perform privileged operations (e.g., I/O requests) |
| **Kernel Mode** | Full Access | OS/kernel runs here; can perform all operations including privileged ones |

### System Calls: The Mechanism for Restricted Operations

**How System Calls Work:**
1. User program calls a library function (e.g., `open()`, `read()`)
2. Library code prepares arguments and system call number
3. Library executes a **trap instruction** (special hardware instruction)
4. Hardware:
   - Saves registers
   - Switches to kernel mode
   - Jumps to trap handler (via trap table)
5. OS handles the system call
6. OS executes **return-from-trap instruction**
   - Restores registers
   - Switches back to user mode
   - Returns to instruction after trap

### Key Insight: System Call Number
- User code places system call number in a register or stack location
- OS checks validity of number before executing corresponding code
- This provides a level of protection (user can't specify exact kernel address)

### Important Details
- **Trap Table**: Set up by OS at boot time; tells hardware where to jump for different exceptions (system calls, interrupts)
- **Trap Instruction**: Must be executed in user mode to trigger a system call
- **Return-from-trap Instruction**: Must be executed in kernel mode to return to user mode

### Security Consideration: User Input Handling
- OS must validate all user inputs to system calls
- Example: For `write()` system call, must check buffer address to prevent kernel memory access
- **Principle**: Treat all user inputs with suspicion - "a secure system must treat user inputs with great suspicion"

## 6.3 Problem #2: Switching Between Processes

### The Challenge
How can the OS regain control of the CPU to switch between processes?

### Cooperative Approach
- OS trusts processes to behave reasonably
- Processes give up CPU via:
  - System calls (e.g., `open()`, `read()`)
  - Illegal operations (e.g., divide by zero, invalid memory access)
  - Explicit `yield()` system call

**Limitation**: If a process enters an infinite loop without making system calls, OS cannot regain control (requires reboot)

### Non-Cooperative Approach: Timer Interrupt
- **Key Insight**: A timer interrupt allows OS to regain control even if processes are non-cooperative
- **How it works**:
  1. At boot time, OS sets up timer interrupt handler in trap table
  2. OS starts the timer (privileged operation)
  3. Timer interrupts CPU every X milliseconds
  4. Hardware saves current state and jumps to interrupt handler
  5. OS regains control and can switch processes

*Figure 6.3: Limited Direct Execution Protocol (Timer Interrupt)*

### Context Switch
- **Definition**: The low-level operation to switch from one process to another
- **How it works**:
  1. Hardware saves current process's registers (onto kernel stack)
  2. OS decides to switch processes (via scheduler)
  3. OS saves current process's context (registers, PC) into process structure
  4. OS restores next process's context (registers, PC) from its process structure
  5. OS switches to new process's kernel stack
  6. OS executes return-from-trap instruction

*Figure 6.4: The xv6 Context Switch Code*

### Context Switch Steps (Detailed)
1. **Timer interrupt occurs**:
   - Hardware saves user registers onto kernel stack
   - Switches to kernel mode
   - Jumps to trap handler

2. **OS handles interrupt**:
   - Decides to switch from Process A to Process B
   - Calls `switch()` routine
   - Saves Process A's registers into its process structure
   - Restores Process B's registers from its process structure
   - Switches to Process B's kernel stack

3. **Return from trap**:
   - Hardware restores Process B's registers from kernel stack
   - Switches to user mode
   - Jumps to Process B's PC

### Key Insight: Two Types of Register Saves/Restores
1. **Hardware implicit save** (during interrupt):
   - User registers saved onto kernel stack
   - Happens automatically when interrupt occurs

2. **Software explicit save** (during context switch):
   - Kernel registers saved into process structure
   - Done by OS code

## 6.4 Worried About Concurrency?

### Challenge
What happens when:
- A timer interrupt occurs during a system call?
- Multiple interrupts occur simultaneously?

### Solutions
1. **Disable interrupts during interrupt processing**:
   - Ensures only one interrupt is handled at a time
   - Risk: Disabling for too long could lead to lost interrupts

2. **Advanced locking schemes**:
   - Protect concurrent access to internal data structures
   - Enable multiple activities within kernel simultaneously
   - Particularly important on multiprocessors

## 6.5 Summary

### Limited Direct Execution (LDE) Protocol
- **Core Idea**: Run programs directly on CPU but with restrictions to maintain OS control
- **Key Components**:
  1. Hardware modes (user mode vs kernel mode)
  2. System calls (via trap instruction)
  3. Timer interrupt (for non-cooperative scheduling)
  4. Context switches (for process switching)

### Analogy: Baby Proofing
- Just as you "baby proof" a room by restricting dangerous elements, the OS "baby proofs" the CPU by:
  1. Setting up trap handlers at boot time
  2. Starting an interrupt timer
  3. Running processes in restricted mode

### Performance Considerations
- **System call cost**: ~4 microseconds (1996), ~0.1-0.5 microseconds (modern systems)
- **Context switch cost**: ~6 microseconds (1996), ~0.1-0.5 microseconds (modern systems)
- **Note**: OS operations are often memory-intensive, so memory bandwidth improvements don't track CPU speed as closely

   - OS starts timer interrupt

2. **When Running a Process**:
   - OS allocates memory, sets up process structure
   - OS executes `return-from-trap` to start process (switches to user mode)
   - Process runs until:
     - Makes system call (traps to OS)
     - Timer interrupt occurs (traps to OS)

3. **When OS Regains Control**:
   - Handles system call or timer interrupt
   - Decides whether to switch processes
   - If switching:
     - Saves current process context
     - Restores next process context
     - Executes `return-from-trap` to resume next process

**Context Switch Measurement**:
- Use two processes communicating via pipes
- One process writes to a pipe, waits for read
- OS switches to other process, which reads from first pipe and writes to second
- Measure communication cost to estimate context switch cost
- Ensure both processes run on the same CPU (use `sched_setaffinity()` on Linux)

**Note**: On multi-CPU systems, ensure both processes are bound to the same processor to measure pure context switch cost.
