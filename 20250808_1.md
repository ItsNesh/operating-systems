## Motivation: Why Study Operating Systems?

### Core Reasons
- **Learning C:** OS development requires C programming
- **Understanding How Stuff Actually Happens:** 
  - Memory management
  - Processes
  - Registers
  - Concurrency
- **Beyond Surface-Level Knowledge:** 
  - Understanding the difference between Mac, Windows, and Linux at a fundamental level
  - Moving beyond "I use a computer" to "How does the computer actually work?"

> **Key Insight:** Operating systems are the layer that makes all other software possible. They abstract hardware complexity so developers don't need to understand every detail of the underlying hardware.

---

## Definitions & History

### What is an Operating System?
- **Definition:** A program/process that controls other processes and simplifies computer operation
- **Core Functions:**
  - Interfaces software and hardware (abstraction)
  - Allocates resources
  - Manages processes and hardware
  - Allows multiprocessing
  - Handles CPU dispatch and memory management

### Historical Context
- **Pre-OS Era:** Human operators manually managed computer programs
  - *Example:* Switchboard operators connecting phone calls
  - *Computer Operator:* Manually loading programs onto punch cards
  - *Problem:* CPU was idle while waiting for input/output (waste of money)

- **Evolution of OS:** 
  - Replaced human operators with software
  - Optimized CPU usage, memory usage, time, and security
  - *Example:* From single-program computers to multi-programming systems

> **Key Insight:** The primary motivation for OS was to maximize CPU utilization by eliminating idle time.

## Virtualization

### Concept
> "To make a thing, like a thing, but not actually a thing, but seem like a thing."

### Why Virtualization?
- **Problem:** Without abstraction, programs must directly interact with hardware
  - *Example:* Program must specify exact printer model (EPSON Stylus S22)
  - *Example:* Program must specify exact memory addresses

- **Solution:** OS provides abstraction layer
  - *Example:* Program simply says "use printer" without specifying model
  - *Example:* Program uses address space without knowing physical memory layout

### Hardware Abstraction
| Hardware Components | Software Abstraction |
|---------------------|----------------------|
| Processor | Thread |
| Memory | Address Space |
| Disks/SSDs | Files |
| Networks | Sockets |
| Machines | Processes |

> **Key Insight:** The OS creates an illusion that each process has its own private universe with infinite resources.

### Advantages of Abstraction
- Code reuse
- Unifies interface for many devices
- Allows higher-level functionality

### Challenges of Abstraction
- What is the best abstraction?
- Functionality vs. Generality
- How much hardware control should be exposed?
- How much does hardware determine the abstraction?

---

## Processes

### Definition
- **Process:** A thread of control (not a program)
- **Components:**
  - Registers
  - Program Counter
  - Stack Pointer
  - Visible address space
  - Open files
  - Open communication channels

### Process vs. Thread
| Feature | Process | Thread |
|---------|---------|--------|
| Memory Space | Private | Shared |
| Program Counter | Separate | Shared |
| Stack | Separate | Shared |
| Registers | Separate | Shared |

> **Key Insight:** "Every process is running at least one (and usually one) thread."

### Process Lifecycle
1. **Initiation:** Loader loads code into memory
   - Fixes pointers (program assumes address 0)
   - Sets up stack layout
   - Handles libraries
2. **Execution:** Process runs in its own address space
3. **Termination:** Process completes or is killed

---

## System Calls & Protection

### Why Protection?
- **Problem:** Processes must be isolated from each other and the OS
  - *Example:* Process 1 shouldn't be able to destroy Process 2
  - *Example:* Process shouldn't be able to destroy the OS itself

### Protection Mechanisms
- **Process Isolation:** Each process has its own address space
- **Kernel Mode:** OS has privileged access to hardware
- **User Mode:** Processes run with restricted access

### System Call Flow
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[User Process] -->|System Call| B[Kernel Mode]
    B --> C[Check Permissions]
    C --> D[Execute Request]
    D --> E[Return Result]
    E --> F[User Mode]
```

### Modes of Execution
| Mode | Permissions | Hardware Access |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| **User Mode** | Limited | No direct hardware access |
| **Kernel Mode** | Full | Direct hardware access |

> **Key Insight:** System calls are like asking a librarian for restricted information—they provide safe access to protected resources.

### System Call Implementation
1. User process calls system call wrapper (e.g., `sys_read`)
2. System call wrapper marshals arguments
3. Hardware triggers trap (mode switch to kernel)
4. Kernel validates request
5. Kernel executes request
6. Kernel returns result to user process

### Interrupts vs. Exceptions
| Type | Trigger | Nature | Example |
|------|---------|--------|---------|
| **Interrupt** | External event | Asynchronous | Timer, I/O device |
| **Exception** | Internal error | Synchronous | Segmentation fault, divide-by-zero |

## Hardware Abstraction (Revision)

### Memory Layout for a Process
```
Memory
┌───────────────┐
│     Data      │ ← Global data
├───────────────┤
│     Code      │ ← Program instructions
├───────────────┤
│     Stack     │ ← Current execution state
└───────────────┘
```

### Key Registers
| Register | Purpose | Example |
|----------|---------|---------|
| Program Counter (PC) | Current instruction | `fac(5)` → `fac(4)` |
| Stack Pointer (SP) | Current stack position | Tracks function calls |
| Accumulator | Temporary storage | Old machines had one |
| Status Register | Flags (overflow, interrupts) | Tracks process state |

### x86 Architecture (32-bit vs 64-bit)
| Register | 32-bit | 64-bit |
|----------|--------|--------|
| Program Counter | EIP | RIP |
| Stack Pointer | ESP | RSP |
| Accumulator | EAX | RAX |
| Base Register | EBX | RBX |
| Counter Register | ECX | RCX |
| Destination Index | EDI | RDI |
| Stack Base Pointer | EBP | RBP |
| Source Index | ESI | RSI |
| Data Register | EDX | RDX |

> **Key Insight:** Different architectures have different register naming conventions, which is why software may need to be compiled for specific platforms.

## OS Dispatch & Scheduling

### Key Questions
1. **When do I do this?** (Scheduling)
   - Use external timer to regain control periodically
   - Time slicing: Do a bit → Interrupt → Do a bit more → Interrupt

2. **How do I do this?** (Dispatching)
   - Save registers for current process
   - Load registers for next process
   - Switch to kernel stack
   - Return from trap

### Process Control Block (PCB)
| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| PID | Process ID |
| Process State | Running, Ready, Blocked |
| Execution State | Registers, PC, SP |
| Scheduling Priority | For scheduling algorithms |
| Accounting Info | Parent/child processes |
| Credentials | Access permissions |
| Open Files | File descriptors |

### Process States
| State | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Running** | Currently executing on CPU |
| **Ready** | Waiting for CPU |
| **Blocked** | Waiting for I/O or other resource |

### Queues
- **Runnable Processes Queue:** Processes ready to run
- **Waiting Queue (I/O):** Processes waiting for I/O operations

## Summary & Key Takeaways

### Core Concepts
1. **Operating Systems** are the interface between hardware and software
2. **Virtualization** creates the illusion that each process has its own private universe
3. **Processes** are threads of control with their own address spaces
4. **System Calls** provide safe access to hardware through kernel mode
5. **Protection** is achieved through mode switching and process isolation

### Design Philosophy
> "Every part of an Operating System is a design decision. There are choices."

### Study Approach
- **Do not memorize:** Understand the "why" behind each design choice
- **Think like a designer:** "How would I build an OS?"
- **Read the textbook:** It's conversational and well-written
- **Start early:** This course has significant content

### Final Thought
> "Operating systems is the subject which will peel apart the differences between Mac, Windows, and Linux at a fundamental level."
