I need to create comprehensive lecture notes for a student who missed class on Week 6, Lecture 6 about Semaphores. I'll synthesize all information from both the slides and transcript into natural, flowing educational notes.

Let me start by organizing my approach:

1. Create a clear H1 title with week and lecture info
2. Add an "Overview" section right after the title
3. Use hierarchical headers to organize content logically
4. Include key insights from the transcript in the specified format
5. Synthesize slide content with transcript explanations naturally
6. Make all technical concepts clear and educational

Let me go through each part of the slides and transcript, identifying key points I need to include:

**Key Topics Covered:**
- Semaphores (definition, history, implementation)
- Comparison between semaphores, mutexes, condition variables
- Building locks from semaphores
- Bounded buffer example with semaphores
- Deadlock theory and examples
- Banker's algorithm

Now I'll create the notes following all requirements:

# Week 6: Lecture 6 - Semaphores, Deadlock, and Banker's Algorithm

## Overview
This lecture covers semaphores as a synchronization primitive in operating systems, their relationship to mutexes and condition variables, practical implementations (including bounded buffers), deadlock theory, and the Banker's algorithm for avoiding deadlocks. The notes synthesize both slide content and instructor explanations from the transcript.

### What Are Semaphores?

Semaphores are a fundamental synchronization mechanism used in concurrent programming to control access to shared resources. Unlike mutexes that only allow one thread at a time (binary state), semaphores maintain a **non-negative integer value** representing available resources.

#### Key Characteristics of Semaphores
- **Stateful**: Maintains an internal count (integer ≥ 0)
- **Atomic Operations**: `wait()` and `post()` are atomic operations
- **No Negative Values**: Prevents over-acquisition

The instructor explained:
> "Semaphores have a state, unlike condition variables. A semaphore is essentially a non-negative integer that represents the number of available resources."

*Instructor Emphasis*: Semaphores solve problems where multiple threads need to coordinate access to limited resources (like parking spaces).

#### Semaphore Operations
- **`wait()`** (also called `P()`, "proberen" - to probe): 
  *Waits until semaphore value > 0, then decrements it*
  
- **`post()`** (also called `V()`, "verhogen" - to increase):
  *Increments the semaphore by 1 and wakes up a waiting thread*

The instructor clarified:
> "If you wait, you're waiting for something positive. If you post, you're incrementing it and waking someone up."

*Practical Example*: The car park analogy where semaphores represent available parking spots (initial value = number of spaces).

#### Semaphores vs Condition Variables
| Feature | Semaphore | Condition Variable |
|---------|-----------|-------------------|
| **State** | Has a state (integer) | No state |
| **Operations** | `wait()`/`post()` | `signal()`, `wait()` with mutex |
| **Use Case** | Counting resources (e.g., parking spots) | Waiting for conditions to be true |

*Instructor Insight*: "Condition variables are good for signaling a condition, but semaphores solve the problem of counting available resources."

---

### Semaphores in Practice

#### Implementation Details
```c
sem_t sem;
sem_init(&sem, 0); // Initialize semaphore with value 0

void wait(sem_t *s) {
    while (s->value <= 0)
        ; // Wait until positive
    s->value--;
}

void post(sem_t *s) {
    s->value++;
}
```

*Instructor Clarification*: "The `wait()` operation is atomic - you can't get interrupted between checking the value and decrementing it."

#### Semaphore History
- Invented by **Edsger Dijkstra** in 1960s (Dutch computer scientist)
- Named after semaphore signals used in communication systems

*Instructor Note*: "The name comes from visual signaling with flags, not train station signals. The Dutch words 'verhogen' and 'proberen' mean 'to increase' and 'to probe', which is why `V` and `P` are sometimes used."

### Building Synchronization Primitives

#### From Semaphore to Mutex
Semaphores can implement mutexes (mutual exclusion locks) by initializing with value 1:

```c
typedef struct __lock_t {
    sem_t sem;
} lock_t;

void init(lock_t *lock) {
    sem_init(&lock->sem, 1);
}

void acquire(lock_t *lock) {
    sem_wait(&lock->sem);
}

void release(lock_t *lock) {
    sem_post(&lock->sem);
}
```

*Instructor Insight*: "A mutex is simply a semaphore with value 1. It's the most basic form of mutual exclusion."

#### From Lock and Condition Variable to Semaphore
Semaphores can be built using locks and condition variables:

```c
typedef struct __sem_t {
    int value;
    cond_t cond;
    lock_t lock;
} sem_t;

void sem_init(sem_t *s, int value) {
    s->value = value;
    cond_init(&s->cond);
    lock_init(&s->lock);
}

void wait(sem_t *s) {
    lock_acquire(&s->lock);
    while (s->value <= 0)
        cond_wait(&s->cond, &s->lock);
    s->value--;
    lock_release(&s->lock);
}

void post(sem_t *s) {
    lock_acquire(&s->lock);
    s->value++;
    cond_signal(&s->cond);
    lock_release(&s->lock);
}
```

*Instructor Note*: "This implementation ensures that `wait()` and `post()` are atomic operations, preventing race conditions."

---

### Bounded Buffer Example

Semaphores are ideal for implementing a bounded buffer (producer-consumer problem).

#### Key Semaphores Needed
- **`emptySlots`**: Number of empty slots in the buffer (initialized to buffer size)
- **`fullSlots`**: Number of full slots in the buffer (initialized to 0)
- **`mutex`**: Ensures mutual exclusion for buffer access (initialized to 1)

*Instructor Explanation*: "This is a cleaner implementation than using just mutexes because it directly represents the state of the buffer."

#### Producer Implementation
```c
void producer(item) {
    sem_wait(&emptySlots); // Wait until space available
    sem_wait(&mutex);      // Acquire exclusive access to buffer
    enqueue(item);         // Add item to buffer
    sem_post(&mutex);      // Release buffer lock
    sem_post(&fullSlots);  // Signal that a slot is now full
}
```

#### Consumer Implementation
```c
void consumer() {
    sem_wait(&fullSlots);   // Wait until something available
    sem_wait(&mutex);       // Acquire exclusive access to buffer
    item = dequeue();       // Remove item from buffer
    sem_post(&mutex);       // Release buffer lock
    sem_post(&emptySlots);  // Signal that a slot is now empty
    return item;
}
```

*Instructor Insight*: "This implementation avoids overfilling the buffer (via `emptySlots`) and underflowing it (via `fullSlots`)."

#### Why Order Matters
The instructor demonstrated what happens if we swap the order of semaphore waits:

```c
// BAD ORDER - CAN CAUSE DEADLOCK
void producer(item) {
    sem_wait(&mutex);
    sem_wait(&emptySlots); // This can deadlock with consumer
    enqueue(item);
    sem_post(&mutex);
    sem_post(&fullSlots);
}
```

*Instructor Example*: "Imagine the buffer is full (10 items). Producer acquires `mutex`, then tries to wait for `emptySlots` but there are none. Consumer has acquired `fullSlots`, wants `mutex`, but producer holds it. Both threads block forever."

---

### Deadlock Theory

Deadlock occurs when multiple processes or threads are blocked waiting for each other to release resources they need.

#### Four Necessary Conditions for Deadlock
1. **Mutual Exclusion**: Resources can only be held by one process at a time.
2. **Hold and Wait**: A process holds some resources while waiting for others.
3. **No Preemption**: Resources cannot be forcibly taken from processes.
4. **Circular Wait**: Processes form a cycle where each waits for the next's resource.

*Instructor Analogy*: "Deadlock is like two people trying to pass through a narrow doorway - both hold their position, neither will move."

#### Real-World Example: Therac-25
The instructor discussed the infamous Therac-25 radiation therapy machine:

> "This machine had timing issues that caused it to deliver lethal doses of radiation. The problem was that when operators rapidly switched between high-dose and low-dose modes, the software didn't properly handle the transition, resulting in no shielding being applied."

*Instructor Note*: "This is a classic case where concurrency errors can have life-or-death consequences."

---

### The Dining Philosophers Problem

A famous deadlock example involving 5 philosophers (or people) who need two chopsticks to eat.

#### Common Solutions
1. **Arbitrary Ordering**: Assign each philosopher a number and require them to pick up the lower-numbered chopstick first.
2. **Randomized Wait Time**: If unable to acquire both chopsticks, wait a random time before retrying.
3. **Centralized Manager**: A single entity (like a waiter) manages chopstick distribution.

*Instructor Insight*: "The problem with arbitrary ordering is determining who goes first in a symmetric environment."

#### Graph Representation of Deadlock
```
Thread 1 → holds lock A, wants lock B
Thread 2 → holds lock B, wants lock A
```

This creates a **circular dependency** that cannot be resolved.

---

### Banker's Algorithm

A deadlock avoidance algorithm used to determine if it's safe to allocate resources without causing deadlock.

#### Key Concepts
- **Max**: Maximum resource requirements for each process.
- **Allocation**: Resources currently allocated to each process.
- **Need**: `Max - Allocation` (resources still needed).
- **Available**: Resources not currently allocated.

*Instructor Example*: "Imagine a castle siege where you need battering rams, ladders, knights, and flags. The algorithm helps determine if all sieges can be completed without deadlock."

#### Banker's Algorithm Steps
1. Set all processes as not ready.
2. Calculate `Need = Max - Allocation` for each process.
3. Find a runnable process where `Need ≤ Available`.
4. Run the process: `Available += Allocation`.
5. Repeat from step 3 until all processes are completed or no more can be run.

#### Example Calculation
| Process | Allocation (A B C D) | Max (A B C D) | Need (A B C D) |
|---------|----------------------|---------------|----------------|
| P0      | 0 0 1 2              | 0 0 1 2       | 0 0 0 0        |
| P1      | 1 0 0 0              | 1 7 5 0       | 0 7 5 0        |
| P2      | 1 3 5 4              | 2 3 5 6       | 1 0 0 2        |
| P3      | 0 6 3 2              | 0 6 5 2       | 0 0 2 0        |
| P4      | 0 0 1 4              | 0 6 5 6       | 0 6 4 2        |

*Available*: (1, 5, 2, 0)

**Step-by-Step Execution:**
1. **P0**: Need = (0,0,0,0) ≤ Available → Run P0
   - Update Available: (1+0, 5+0, 2+1, 0+2) = (1, 5, 3, 2)
2. **P2**: Need = (1,0,0,2) ≤ Available → Run P2
   - Update Available: (1+1, 5+3, 3+5, 2+4) = (2, 8, 8, 6)
3. **P3**: Need = (0,0,2,0) ≤ Available → Run P3
   - Update Available: (2+0, 8+6, 8+3, 6+2) = (2, 14, 11, 8)
4. **P4**: Need = (0,6,4,2) ≤ Available → Run P4
   - Update Available: (2+0, 14+0, 11+1, 8+4) = (2, 14, 12, 12)
5. **P1**: Need = (0,7,5,0) ≤ Available → Run P1

*Instructor Note*: "This is why it's called the 'Banker's Algorithm' - you're like a banker deciding whether to loan money based on your ability to repay."

### Deadlock Prevention Strategies

#### 1. Eliminate Mutual Exclusion
- **Approach**: Use lock-free data structures with atomic operations.
- **Example**:
  ```c
  void add(int *val, int amt) {
      do {
          int old = *val;
      } while (!compare_and_swap(val, old, old + amt));
  }
  ```
  
*Instructor Insight*: "This avoids locks entirely by using atomic compare-and-swap operations."

#### 2. Eliminate Hold and Wait
- **Approach**: Use a meta-lock to acquire all needed resources at once.
- **Example**:
  ```c
  lock(&meta);
  lock(&A);
  lock(&B);
  // ... use A and B ...
  unlock(&B);
  unlock(&A);
  unlock(&meta);
  ```
  
*Instructor Note*: "This creates a bottleneck but eliminates circular wait."

#### 3. Add Preemption
- **Approach**: Allow processes to release resources if they can't acquire others.
- **Example**:
  ```c
  top:
      lock(A);
      if (try_lock(B) == -1) {
          unlock(A);
          goto top;
      }
  ```
  
*Instructor Clarification*: "This creates a livelock, where processes are constantly trying but making no progress."

#### 4. Eliminate Circular Wait
- **Approach**: Enforce strict ordering of resource acquisition.
- **Example**:
  ```c
  if (address(A) < address(B)) {
      lock(A);
      lock(B);
  } else {
      lock(B);
      lock(A);
  }
  ```
  
*Instructor Insight*: "This is the most reliable method for preventing deadlock in complex systems."

---

### Livelock vs. Deadlock

| Feature | Deadlock | Livelock |
|---------|----------|----------|
| **State** | Processes are blocked and not making progress | Processes are active but not making progress |
| **Cause** | Circular wait with resources held indefinitely | Constant resource acquisition/releasing without progress |
| **Example** | Two people trying to pass through a narrow doorway, each waiting for the other to move | Traffic at an intersection where cars keep yielding to each other |

*Instructor Example*: "Livelock is like two drivers at a roundabout: 'You go first,' 'No, you go first,' and they just circle around without making progress."

---

# Week 6: Lecture 6 - Semaphores, Deadlock, and Banker's Algorithm

## Overview
This lecture explores semaphores as a fundamental synchronization mechanism in operating systems, their relationship to mutexes and condition variables, practical implementations (including bounded buffers), deadlock theory, and the Banker's algorithm for avoiding deadlocks. The notes synthesize both slide content and instructor explanations from the transcript.

---

### What Are Semaphores?

Semaphores are **stateful synchronization primitives** that maintain a non-negative integer value representing available resources. Unlike mutexes (which only allow one thread at a time), semaphores directly represent resource counts, making them ideal for managing limited resources like parking spots or buffer slots.

#### Key Characteristics
- **Stateful**: Maintains an internal count (integer ≥ 0)
- **Atomic Operations**: `wait()` and `post()` are indivisible operations
- **No Negative Values**: Prevents over-acquisition of resources

### Key Insight from Transcript
> "Semaphores have a state, unlike condition variables. A semaphore is essentially a non-negative integer that represents the number of available resources."

*Instructor Emphasis*: Semaphores solve problems where multiple threads need to coordinate access to limited resources (like parking spots).

#### Semaphore Operations
| Operation | Description | Alternative Name |
|-----------|-------------|------------------|
| `wait()`  | Waits until semaphore value > 0, then decrements it | `P()`, "proberen" (to probe) |
| `post()`  | Increments the semaphore by 1 and wakes up a waiting thread | `V()`, "verhogen" (to increase) |

*Practical Example*: The car park analogy where semaphores represent available parking spots (initial value = number of spaces).

---

### Semaphores vs. Other Synchronization Primitives

| Feature | Semaphore | Mutex | Condition Variable |
|---------|-----------|-------|-------------------|
| **State** | Has a state (integer) | Binary state (0/1) | No state |
| **Operations** | `wait()`/`post()` | `lock()`, `unlock()` | `signal()`, `wait()` with mutex |
| **Use Case** | Counting resources (e.g., parking spots) | Exclusive access to a single resource | Waiting for conditions to be true |

*Instructor Insight*: "Condition variables are good for signaling a condition, but semaphores solve the problem of counting available resources."

---

### Semaphores in Practice

#### Implementation Details
```c
sem_t sem;
sem_init(&sem, 0); // Initialize semaphore with value 0

void wait(sem_t *s) {
    while (s->value <= 0)
        ; // Wait until positive
    s->value--;
}

void post(sem_t *s) {
    s->value++;
}
```

*Instructor Clarification*: "The `wait()` operation is atomic - you can't get interrupted between checking the value and decrementing it."

#### Semaphore History
- Invented by **Edsger Dijkstra** in 1960s (Dutch computer scientist)
- Named after semaphore signals used in communication systems

*Instructor Note*: "The name comes from visual signaling with flags, not train station signals. The Dutch words 'verhogen' and 'proberen' mean 'to increase' and 'to probe', which is why `V` and `P` are sometimes used."

---

### Building Synchronization Primitives

#### From Semaphore to Mutex
Semaphores can implement mutexes (mutual exclusion locks) by initializing with value 1:

```c
typedef struct __lock_t {
    sem_t sem;
} lock_t;

void init(lock_t *lock) {
    sem_init(&lock->sem, 1);
}

void acquire(lock_t *lock) {
    sem_wait(&lock->sem);
}

void release(lock_t *lock) {
    sem_post(&lock->sem);
}
```

*Instructor Insight*: "A mutex is simply a semaphore with value 1. It's the most basic form of mutual exclusion."

#### From Lock and Condition Variable to Semaphore
Semaphores can be built using locks and condition variables:

```c
typedef struct __sem_t {
    int value;
    cond_t cond;
    lock_t lock;
} sem_t;

void sem_init(sem_t *s, int value) {
    s->value = value;
    cond_init(&s->cond);
    lock_init(&s->lock);
}

void wait(sem_t *s) {
    lock_acquire(&s->lock);
    while (s->value <= 0)
        cond_wait(&s->cond, &s->lock);
    s->value--;
    lock_release(&s->lock);
}

void post(sem_t *s) {
    lock_acquire(&s->lock);
    s->value++;
    cond_signal(&s->cond);
    lock_release(&s->lock);
}
```

*Instructor Note*: "This implementation ensures that `wait()` and `post()` are atomic operations, preventing race conditions."

---

### Bounded Buffer Example

Semaphores are ideal for implementing a bounded buffer (producer-consumer problem).

#### Key Semaphores Needed
- **`emptySlots`**: Number of empty slots in the buffer (initialized to buffer size)
- **`fullSlots`**: Number of full slots in the buffer (initialized to 0)
- **`mutex`**: Ensures mutual exclusion for buffer access (initialized to 1)

*Instructor Explanation*: "This is a cleaner implementation than using just mutexes because it directly represents the state of the buffer."

#### Producer Implementation
```c
void producer(item) {
    sem_wait(&emptySlots); // Wait until space available
    sem_wait(&mutex);      // Acquire exclusive access to buffer
    enqueue(item);         // Add item to buffer
    sem_post(&mutex);      // Release buffer lock
    sem_post(&fullSlots);  // Signal that a slot is now full
}
```

#### Consumer Implementation
```c
void consumer() {
    sem_wait(&fullSlots);   // Wait until something available
    sem_wait(&mutex);       // Acquire exclusive access to buffer
    item = dequeue();       // Remove item from buffer
    sem_post(&mutex);       // Release buffer lock
    sem_post(&emptySlots);  // Signal that a slot is now empty
    return item;
}
```

*Instructor Insight*: "This implementation avoids overfilling the buffer (via `emptySlots`) and underflowing it (via `fullSlots`)."

#### Why Order Matters
The instructor demonstrated what happens if we swap the order of semaphore waits:

```c
// BAD ORDER - CAN CAUSE DEADLOCK
void producer(item) {
    sem_wait(&mutex);
    sem_wait(&emptySlots); // This can deadlock with consumer
    enqueue(item);
    sem_post(&mutex);
    sem_post(&fullSlots);
}
```

*Instructor Example*: "Imagine the buffer is full (10 items). Producer acquires `mutex`, then tries to wait for `emptySlots` but there are none. Consumer has acquired `fullSlots`, wants `mutex`, but producer holds it. Both threads block forever."

---

### Deadlock Theory

Deadlock occurs when multiple processes or threads are blocked waiting for each other to release resources they need.

#### Four Necessary Conditions for Deadlock
1. **Mutual Exclusion**: Resources can only be held by one process at a time.
2. **Hold and Wait**: A process holds some resources while waiting for others.
3. **No Preemption**: Resources cannot be forcibly taken from processes.
4. **Circular Wait**: Processes form a cycle where each waits for the next's resource.

*Instructor Analogy*: "Deadlock is like two people trying to pass through a narrow doorway - both hold their position, neither will move."

#### Real-World Example: Therac-25
The instructor discussed the infamous Therac-25 radiation therapy machine:

> "This machine had timing issues that caused it to deliver lethal doses of radiation. The problem was that when operators rapidly switched between high-dose and low-dose modes, the software didn't properly handle the transition, resulting in no shielding being applied."

*Instructor Note*: "This is a classic case where concurrency errors can have life-or-death consequences."

---

### The Dining Philosophers Problem

A famous deadlock example involving 5 philosophers (or people) who need two chopsticks to eat.

#### Common Solutions
1. **Arbitrary Ordering**: Assign each philosopher a number and require them to pick up the lower-numbered chopstick first.
2. **Randomized Wait Time**: If unable to acquire both chopsticks, wait a random time before retrying.
3. **Centralized Manager**: A single entity (like a waiter) manages chopstick distribution.

*Instructor Insight*: "The problem with arbitrary ordering is determining who goes first in a symmetric environment."

#### Graph Representation of Deadlock
```
Thread 1 → holds lock A, wants lock B
Thread 2 → holds lock B, wants lock A
```

This creates a **circular dependency** that cannot be resolved.

---

### Banker's Algorithm

A deadlock avoidance algorithm used to determine if it's safe to allocate resources without causing deadlock.

#### Key Concepts
- **Max**: Maximum resource requirements for each process.
- **Allocation**: Resources currently allocated to each process.
- **Need**: `Max - Allocation` (resources still needed).
- **Available**: Resources not currently allocated.

*Instructor Example*: "Imagine a castle siege where you need battering rams, ladders, knights, and flags. The algorithm helps determine if all sieges can be completed without deadlock."

#### Banker's Algorithm Steps
1. Set all processes as not ready.
2. Calculate `Need = Max - Allocation` for each process.
3. Find a runnable process where `Need ≤ Available`.
4. Run the process: `Available += Allocation`.
5. Repeat from step 3 until all processes are completed or no more can be run.

#### Example Calculation
| Process | Allocation (A B C D) | Max (A B C D) | Need (A B C D) |
|---------|----------------------|---------------|----------------|

*Available*: (1, 5, 2, 0)

**Step-by-Step Execution:**
1. **P0**: Need = (0,0,0,0) ≤ Available → Run P0
   - Update Available: (1+0, 5+0, 2+1, 0+2) = (1, 5, 3, 2)
2. **P2**: Need = (1,0,0,2) ≤ Available → Run P2
   - Update Available: (1+1, 5+3, 3+5, 2+4) = (2, 8, 8, 6)
3. **P3**: Need = (0,0,2,0) ≤ Available → Run P3
   - Update Available: (2+0, 8+6, 8+3, 6+2) = (2, 14, 11, 8)
4. **P4**: Need = (0,6,4,2) ≤ Available → Run P4
   - Update Available: (2+0, 14+0, 11+1, 8+4) = (2, 14, 12, 12)
5. **P1**: Need = (0,7,5,0) ≤ Available → Run P1

### Deadlock Prevention Strategies

#### 1. Eliminate Mutual Exclusion
- **Approach**: Use lock-free data structures with atomic operations.
- **Example**:
  ```c
  void add(int *val, int amt) {
      do {
          int old = *val;
      } while (!compare_and_swap(val, old, old + amt));
  }
  ```
  
*Instructor Insight*: "This avoids locks entirely by using atomic compare-and-swap operations."

#### 2. Eliminate Hold and Wait
- **Approach**: Use a meta-lock to acquire all needed resources at once.
- **Example**:
  ```c
  lock(&meta);
  lock(&A);
  lock(&B);
  // ... use A and B ...
  unlock(&B);
  unlock(&A);
  unlock(&meta);
  ```
  
*Instructor Note*: "This creates a bottleneck but eliminates circular wait."

#### 3. Add Preemption
- **Approach**: Allow processes to release resources if they can't acquire others.
- **Example**:
  ```c
  top:
      lock(A);
      if (try_lock(B) == -1) {
          unlock(A);
          goto top;
      }
  ```
  
*Instructor Clarification*: "This creates a livelock, where processes are constantly trying but making no progress."

#### 4. Eliminate Circular Wait
- **Approach**: Enforce strict ordering of resource acquisition.
- **Example**:
  ```c
  if (address(A) < address(B)) {
      lock(A);
      lock(B);
  } else {
      lock(B);
      lock(A);
  }
  ```
  
*Instructor Insight*: "This is the most reliable method for preventing deadlock in complex systems."

### Livelock vs. Deadlock

| Feature | Deadlock | Livelock |
|---------|----------|----------|
| **State** | Processes are blocked and not making progress | Processes are active but not making progress |
| **Cause** | Circular wait with resources held indefinitely | Constant resource acquisition/releasing without progress |
| **Example** | Two people trying to pass through a narrow doorway, each waiting for the other to move | Traffic at an intersection where cars keep yielding to each other |

*Instructor Example*: "Livelock is like two drivers at a roundabout: 'You go first,' 'No, you go first,' and they just circle around without making progress."

## Summary

### Key Takeaways
- **Semaphores** are stateful synchronization primitives with integer values representing available resources.
- Semaphores can implement mutexes (value = 1) and condition variables (with additional logic).
- The **bounded buffer problem** demonstrates semaphores' utility in producer-consumer scenarios.
- **Deadlock** requires four conditions: mutual exclusion, hold and wait, no preemption, circular wait.
- **Banker's algorithm** is a deadlock avoidance strategy that calculates safe resource allocation sequences.
- **Livelock** differs from deadlock as processes are active but making no progress.

### Practical Applications
1. Semaphores for managing limited resources (e.g., database connections)
2. Banker's algorithm in operating system resource management
3. Deadlock prevention strategies in multi-threaded applications

## Practical Exercises

1. **Semaphore Implementation**: Write a complete implementation of semaphores using mutexes and condition variables.

2. **Deadlock Analysis**: Given the following resource allocation, determine if deadlock is possible:
   - Process A holds R1, wants R2
   - Process B holds R2, wants R1

3. **Banker's Algorithm Practice**: Apply Banker's algorithm to a new set of processes with different max and allocation values.

4. **Bounded Buffer Simulation**: Simulate the producer-consumer problem using semaphores in code (pseudocode is acceptable).

5. **Deadlock Prevention**: Design a system that uses strict ordering for resource acquisition to prevent deadlock.
