# Week 6: Lecture 6 - Semaphores, Deadlock, and Banker's Algorithm

<think>
I need to create comprehensive lecture notes for a student who missed class on Week 6, Lecture 6 about Semaphores. I'll synthesize all information from both the slides and transcript into natural, flowing educational notes.

Let me start by organizing my approach:

1. Create a clear H1 title with week and lecture info
2. Add an "Overview" section right after the title
3. Use hierarchical headers to organize content logically
4. Include key insights from the transcript in the specified format
5. Synthesize slide content with transcript explanations naturally
6. Make all technical concepts clear and educational

Let me go through each part of the slides and transcript, identifying key points I need to include:

**Key Topics Covered:**
- Semaphores (definition, history, implementation)
- Comparison between semaphores, mutexes, condition variables
- Building locks from semaphores
- Bounded buffer example with semaphores
- Deadlock theory and examples
- Banker's algorithm

Now I'll create the notes following all requirements:


### Overview
This lecture covers semaphores as a synchronization primitive in operating systems, their relationship to mutexes and condition variables, practical implementations (including bounded buffers), deadlock theory, and the Banker's algorithm for avoiding deadlocks. The notes synthesize both slide content and instructor explanations from the transcript.

#### What Are Semaphores?

Semaphores are a fundamental synchronization mechanism used in concurrent programming to control access to shared resources. Unlike mutexes that only allow one thread at a time (binary state), semaphores maintain a **non-negative integer value** representing available resources.

##### Key Characteristics of Semaphores
- **Stateful**: Maintains an internal count (integer ≥ 0)
- **Atomic Operations**: `wait()` and `post()` are atomic operations
- **No Negative Values**: Prevents over-acquisition

The instructor explained:
> "Semaphores have a state, unlike condition variables. A semaphore is essentially a non-negative integer that represents the number of available resources."

*Instructor Emphasis*: Semaphores solve problems where multiple threads need to coordinate access to limited resources (like parking spaces).

##### Semaphore Operations
- **`wait()`** (also called `P()`, "proberen" - to probe): 
  *Waits until semaphore value > 0, then decrements it*
  
- **`post()`** (also called `V()`, "verhogen" - to increase):
  *Increments the semaphore by 1 and wakes up a waiting thread*

The instructor clarified:
> "If you wait, you're waiting for something positive. If you post, you're incrementing it and waking someone up."

*Practical Example*: The car park analogy where semaphores represent available parking spots (initial value = number of spaces).

##### Semaphores vs Condition Variables
| Feature | Semaphore | Condition Variable |
|---------|-----------|-------------------|
| **State** | Has a state (integer) | No state |
| **Operations** | `wait()`/`post()` | `signal()`, `wait()` with mutex |
| **Use Case** | Counting resources (e.g., parking spots) | Waiting for conditions to be true |

*Instructor Insight*: "Condition variables are good for signaling a condition, but semaphores solve the problem of counting available resources."

---

#### Semaphores in Practice

##### Implementation Details
```c
sem_t sem;
sem_init(&sem, 0); // Initialize semaphore with value 0

void wait(sem_t *s) {
    while (s->value <= 0)
        ; // Wait until positive
    s->value--;
}

void post(sem_t *s) {
    s->value++;
}
```

*Instructor Clarification*: "The `wait()` operation is atomic - you can't get interrupted between checking the value and decrementing it."

##### Semaphore History
- Invented by **Edsger Dijkstra** in 1960s (Dutch computer scientist)
- Named after semaphore signals used in communication systems

*Instructor Note*: "The name comes from visual signaling with flags, not train station signals. The Dutch words 'verhogen' and 'proberen' mean 'to increase' and 'to probe', which is why `V` and `P` are sometimes used."

---

#### Building Synchronization Primitives

##### From Semaphore to Mutex
Semaphores can implement mutexes (mutual exclusion locks) by initializing with value 1:

```c
typedef struct __lock_t {
    sem_t sem;
} lock_t;

void init(lock_t *lock) {
    sem_init(&lock->sem, 1);
}

void acquire(lock_t *lock) {
    sem_wait(&lock->sem);
}

void release(lock_t *lock) {
    sem_post(&lock->sem);
}
```

*Instructor Insight*: "A mutex is simply a semaphore with value 1. It's the most basic form of mutual exclusion."

##### From Lock and Condition Variable to Semaphore
Semaphores can be built using locks and condition variables:

```c
typedef struct __sem_t {
    int value;
    cond_t cond;
    lock_t lock;
} sem_t;

void sem_init(sem_t *s, int value) {
    s->value = value;
    cond_init(&s->cond);
    lock_init(&s->lock);
}

void wait(sem_t *s) {
    lock_acquire(&s->lock);
    while (s->value <= 0)
        cond_wait(&s->cond, &s->lock);
    s->value--;
    lock_release(&s->lock);
}

void post(sem_t *s) {
    lock_acquire(&s->lock);
    s->value++;
    cond_signal(&s->cond);
    lock_release(&s->lock);
}
```

*Instructor Note*: "This implementation ensures that `wait()` and `post()` are atomic operations, preventing race conditions."

---

#### Bounded Buffer Example

Semaphores are ideal for implementing a bounded buffer (producer-consumer problem).

##### Key Semaphores Needed
- **`emptySlots`**: Number of empty slots in the buffer (initialized to buffer size)
- **`fullSlots`**: Number of full slots in the buffer (initialized to 0)
- **`mutex`**: Ensures mutual exclusion for buffer access (initialized to 1)

*Instructor Explanation*: "This is a cleaner implementation than using just mutexes because it directly represents the state of the buffer."

##### Producer Implementation
```c
void producer(item) {
    sem_wait(&emptySlots); // Wait until space available
    sem_wait(&mutex);      // Acquire exclusive access to buffer
    enqueue(item);         // Add item to buffer
    sem_post(&mutex);      // Release buffer lock
    sem_post(&fullSlots);  // Signal that a slot is now full
}
```

##### Consumer Implementation
```c
void consumer() {
    sem_wait(&fullSlots);   // Wait until something available
    sem_wait(&mutex);       // Acquire exclusive access to buffer
    item = dequeue();       // Remove item from buffer
    sem_post(&mutex);       // Release buffer lock
    sem_post(&emptySlots);  // Signal that a slot is now empty
    return item;
}
```

*Instructor Insight*: "This implementation avoids overfilling the buffer (via `emptySlots`) and underflowing it (via `fullSlots`)."

##### Why Order Matters
The instructor demonstrated what happens if we swap the order of semaphore waits:

```c
// BAD ORDER - CAN CAUSE DEADLOCK
void producer(item) {
    sem_wait(&mutex);
    sem_wait(&emptySlots); // This can deadlock with consumer
    enqueue(item);
    sem_post(&mutex);
    sem_post(&fullSlots);
}
```

*Instructor Example*: "Imagine the buffer is full (10 items). Producer acquires `mutex`, then tries to wait for `emptySlots` but there are none. Consumer has acquired `fullSlots`, wants `mutex`, but producer holds it. Both threads block forever."

---

#### Deadlock Theory

Deadlock occurs when multiple processes or threads are blocked waiting for each other to release resources they need.

##### Four Necessary Conditions for Deadlock
1. **Mutual Exclusion**: Resources can only be held by one process at a time.
2. **Hold and Wait**: A process holds some resources while waiting for others.
3. **No Preemption**: Resources cannot be forcibly taken from processes.
4. **Circular Wait**: Processes form a cycle where each waits for the next's resource.

*Instructor Analogy*: "Deadlock is like two people trying to pass through a narrow doorway - both hold their position, neither will move."

##### Real-World Example: Therac-25
The instructor discussed the infamous Therac-25 radiation therapy machine:

> "This machine had timing issues that caused it to deliver lethal doses of radiation. The problem was that when operators rapidly switched between high-dose and low-dose modes, the software didn't properly handle the transition, resulting in no shielding being applied."

*Instructor Note*: "This is a classic case where concurrency errors can have life-or-death consequences."

---

#### The Dining Philosophers Problem

A famous deadlock example involving 5 philosophers (or people) who need two chopsticks to eat.

##### Common Solutions
1. **Arbitrary Ordering**: Assign each philosopher a number and require them to pick up the lower-numbered chopstick first.
2. **Randomized Wait Time**: If unable to acquire both chopsticks, wait a random time before retrying.
3. **Centralized Manager**: A single entity (like a waiter) manages chopstick distribution.

*Instructor Insight*: "The problem with arbitrary ordering is determining who goes first in a symmetric environment."

##### Graph Representation of Deadlock
```
Thread 1 → holds lock A, wants lock B
Thread 2 → holds lock B, wants lock A
```

This creates a **circular dependency** that cannot be resolved.

---

#### Banker's Algorithm

A deadlock avoidance algorithm used to determine if it's safe to allocate resources without causing deadlock.

##### Key Concepts
- **Max**: Maximum resource requirements for each process.
- **Allocation**: Resources currently allocated to each process.
- **Need**: `Max - Allocation` (resources still needed).
- **Available**: Resources not currently allocated.

*Instructor Example*: "Imagine a castle siege where you need battering rams, ladders, knights, and flags. The algorithm helps determine if all sieges can be completed without deadlock."

##### Banker's Algorithm Steps
1. Set all processes as not ready.
2. Calculate `Need = Max - Allocation` for each process.
3. Find a runnable process where `Need ≤ Available`.
4. Run the process: `Available += Allocation`.
5. Repeat from step 3 until all processes are completed or no more can be run.

##### Example Calculation
| Process | Allocation (A B C D) | Max (A B C D) | Need (A B C D) |
|---------|----------------------|---------------|----------------|
| P0      | 0 0 1 2              | 0 0 1 2       | 0 0 0 0        |
| P1      | 1 0 0 0              | 1 7 5 0       | 0 7 5 0        |
| P2      | 1 3 5 4              | 2 3 5 6       | 1 0 0 2        |
| P3      | 0 6 3 2              | 0 6 5 2       | 0 0 2 0        |
| P4      | 0 0 1 4              | 0 6 5 6       | 0 6 4 2        |

*Available*: (1, 5, 2, 0)

**Step-by-Step Execution:**
1. **P0**: Need = (0,0,0,0) ≤ Available → Run P0
   - Update Available: (1+0, 5+0, 2+1, 0+2) = (1, 5, 3, 2)
2. **P2**: Need = (1,0,0,2) ≤ Available → Run P2
   - Update Available: (1+1, 5+3, 3+5, 2+4) = (2, 8, 8, 6)
3. **P3**: Need = (0,0,2,0) ≤ Available → Run P3
   - Update Available: (2+0, 8+6, 8+3, 6+2) = (2, 14, 11, 8)
4. **P4**: Need = (0,6,4,2) ≤ Available → Run P4
   - Update Available: (2+0, 14+0, 11+1, 8+4) = (2, 14, 12, 12)
5. **P1**: Need = (0,7,5,0) ≤ Available → Run P1

*Instructor Note*: "This is why it's called the 'Banker's Algorithm' - you're like a banker deciding whether to loan money based on your ability to repay."

---

#### Deadlock Prevention Strategies

##### 1. Eliminate Mutual Exclusion
- **Approach**: Use lock-free data structures with atomic operations.
- **Example**:
  ```c
  void add(int *val, int amt) {
      do {
          int old = *val;
      } while (!compare_and_swap(val, old, old + amt));
  }
  ```
  
*Instructor Insight*: "This avoids locks entirely by using atomic compare-and-swap operations."

##### 2. Eliminate Hold and Wait
- **Approach**: Use a meta-lock to acquire all needed resources at once.
- **Example**:
  ```c
  lock(&meta);
  lock(&A);
  lock(&B);
  // ... use A and B ...
  unlock(&B);
  unlock(&A);
  unlock(&meta);
  ```
  
*Instructor Note*: "This creates a bottleneck but eliminates circular wait."

##### 3. Add Preemption
- **Approach**: Allow processes to release resources if they can't acquire others.
- **Example**:
  ```c
  top:
      lock(A);
      if (try_lock(B) == -1) {
          unlock(A);
          goto top;
      }
  ```
  
*Instructor Clarification*: "This creates a livelock, where processes are constantly trying but making no progress."

##### 4. Eliminate Circular Wait
- **Approach**: Enforce strict ordering of resource acquisition.
- **Example**:
  ```c
  if (address(A) < address(B)) {
      lock(A);
      lock(B);
  } else {
      lock(B);
      lock(A);
  }
  ```
  
*Instructor Insight*: "This is the most reliable method for preventing deadlock in complex systems."

---

#### Livelock vs. Deadlock

| Feature | Deadlock | Livelock |
|---------|----------|----------|
| **State** | Processes are blocked and not making progress | Processes are active but not making progress |
| **Cause** | Circular wait with resources held indefinitely | Constant resource acquisition/releasing without progress |
| **Example** | Two people trying to pass through a narrow doorway, each waiting for the other to move | Traffic at an intersection where cars keep yielding to each other |

*Instructor Example*: "Livelock is like two drivers at a roundabout: 'You go first,' 'No, you go first,' and they just circle around without making progress."

# Week 6: Lecture 6 - Semaphores, Deadlock, and Banker's Algorithm

### Overview
This lecture explores semaphores as a fundamental synchronization mechanism in operating systems, their relationship to mutexes and condition variables, practical implementations (including bounded buffers), deadlock theory, and the Banker's algorithm for avoiding deadlocks. The notes synthesize both slide content and instructor explanations from the transcript.

---

#### What Are Semaphores?

Semaphores are **stateful synchronization primitives** that maintain a non-negative integer value representing available resources. Unlike mutexes (which only allow one thread at a time), semaphores directly represent resource counts, making them ideal for managing limited resources like parking spots or buffer slots.

##### Key Characteristics
- **Stateful**: Maintains an internal count (integer ≥ 0)
- **Atomic Operations**: `wait()` and `post()` are indivisible operations
- **No Negative Values**: Prevents over-acquisition of resources

#### Key Insight from Transcript
> "Semaphores have a state, unlike condition variables. A semaphore is essentially a non-negative integer that represents the number of available resources."

*Instructor Emphasis*: Semaphores solve problems where multiple threads need to coordinate access to limited resources (like parking spots).

##### Semaphore Operations
| Operation | Description | Alternative Name |
|-----------|-------------|------------------|
| `wait()`  | Waits until semaphore value > 0, then decrements it | `P()`, "proberen" (to probe) |
| `post()`  | Increments the semaphore by 1 and wakes up a waiting thread | `V()`, "verhogen" (to increase) |

*Practical Example*: The car park analogy where semaphores represent available parking spots (initial value = number of spaces).

---

#### Semaphores vs. Other Synchronization Primitives

| Feature | Semaphore | Mutex | Condition Variable |
|---------|-----------|-------|-------------------|
| **State** | Has a state (integer) | Binary state (0/1) | No state |
| **Operations** | `wait()`/`post()` | `lock()`, `unlock()` | `signal()`, `wait()` with mutex |
| **Use Case** | Counting resources (e.g., parking spots) | Exclusive access to a single resource | Waiting for conditions to be true |

*Instructor Insight*: "Condition variables are good for signaling a condition, but semaphores solve the problem of counting available resources."

---

#### Semaphores in Practice

##### Implementation Details
```c
sem_t sem;
sem_init(&sem, 0); // Initialize semaphore with value 0

void wait(sem_t *s) {
    while (s->value <= 0)
        ; // Wait until positive
    s->value--;
}

void post(sem_t *s) {
    s->value++;
}
```

*Instructor Clarification*: "The `wait()` operation is atomic - you can't get interrupted between checking the value and decrementing it."

##### Semaphore History
- Invented by **Edsger Dijkstra** in 1960s (Dutch computer scientist)
- Named after semaphore signals used in communication systems

*Instructor Note*: "The name comes from visual signaling with flags, not train station signals. The Dutch words 'verhogen' and 'proberen' mean 'to increase' and 'to probe', which is why `V` and `P` are sometimes used."

---

#### Building Synchronization Primitives

##### From Semaphore to Mutex
Semaphores can implement mutexes (mutual exclusion locks) by initializing with value 1:

```c
typedef struct __lock_t {
    sem_t sem;
} lock_t;

void init(lock_t *lock) {
    sem_init(&lock->sem, 1);
}

void acquire(lock_t *lock) {
    sem_wait(&lock->sem);
}

void release(lock_t *lock) {
    sem_post(&lock->sem);
}
```

*Instructor Insight*: "A mutex is simply a semaphore with value 1. It's the most basic form of mutual exclusion."

##### From Lock and Condition Variable to Semaphore
Semaphores can be built using locks and condition variables:

```c
typedef struct __sem_t {
    int value;
    cond_t cond;
    lock_t lock;
} sem_t;

void sem_init(sem_t *s, int value) {
    s->value = value;
    cond_init(&s->cond);
    lock_init(&s->lock);
}

void wait(sem_t *s) {
    lock_acquire(&s->lock);
    while (s->value <= 0)
        cond_wait(&s->cond, &s->lock);
    s->value--;
    lock_release(&s->lock);
}

void post(sem_t *s) {
    lock_acquire(&s->lock);
    s->value++;
    cond_signal(&s->cond);
    lock_release(&s->lock);
}
```

*Instructor Note*: "This implementation ensures that `wait()` and `post()` are atomic operations, preventing race conditions."

---

#### Bounded Buffer Example

Semaphores are ideal for implementing a bounded buffer (producer-consumer problem).

##### Key Semaphores Needed
- **`emptySlots`**: Number of empty slots in the buffer (initialized to buffer size)
- **`fullSlots`**: Number of full slots in the buffer (initialized to 0)
- **`mutex`**: Ensures mutual exclusion for buffer access (initialized to 1)

*Instructor Explanation*: "This is a cleaner implementation than using just mutexes because it directly represents the state of the buffer."

##### Producer Implementation
```c
void producer(item) {
    sem_wait(&emptySlots); // Wait until space available
    sem_wait(&mutex);      // Acquire exclusive access to buffer
    enqueue(item);         // Add item to buffer
    sem_post(&mutex);      // Release buffer lock
    sem_post(&fullSlots);  // Signal that a slot is now full
}
```

##### Consumer Implementation
```c
void consumer() {
    sem_wait(&fullSlots);   // Wait until something available
    sem_wait(&mutex);       // Acquire exclusive access to buffer
    item = dequeue();       // Remove item from buffer
    sem_post(&mutex);       // Release buffer lock
    sem_post(&emptySlots);  // Signal that a slot is now empty
    return item;
}
```

*Instructor Insight*: "This implementation avoids overfilling the buffer (via `emptySlots`) and underflowing it (via `fullSlots`)."

##### Why Order Matters
The instructor demonstrated what happens if we swap the order of semaphore waits:

```c
// BAD ORDER - CAN CAUSE DEADLOCK
void producer(item) {
    sem_wait(&mutex);
    sem_wait(&emptySlots); // This can deadlock with consumer
    enqueue(item);
    sem_post(&mutex);
    sem_post(&fullSlots);
}
```

*Instructor Example*: "Imagine the buffer is full (10 items). Producer acquires `mutex`, then tries to wait for `emptySlots` but there are none. Consumer has acquired `fullSlots`, wants `mutex`, but producer holds it. Both threads block forever."

---

#### Deadlock Theory

Deadlock occurs when multiple processes or threads are blocked waiting for each other to release resources they need.

##### Four Necessary Conditions for Deadlock
1. **Mutual Exclusion**: Resources can only be held by one process at a time.
2. **Hold and Wait**: A process holds some resources while waiting for others.
3. **No Preemption**: Resources cannot be forcibly taken from processes.
4. **Circular Wait**: Processes form a cycle where each waits for the next's resource.

*Instructor Analogy*: "Deadlock is like two people trying to pass through a narrow doorway - both hold their position, neither will move."

##### Real-World Example: Therac-25
The instructor discussed the infamous Therac-25 radiation therapy machine:

> "This machine had timing issues that caused it to deliver lethal doses of radiation. The problem was that when operators rapidly switched between high-dose and low-dose modes, the software didn't properly handle the transition, resulting in no shielding being applied."

*Instructor Note*: "This is a classic case where concurrency errors can have life-or-death consequences."

---

#### The Dining Philosophers Problem

A famous deadlock example involving 5 philosophers (or people) who need two chopsticks to eat.

##### Common Solutions
1. **Arbitrary Ordering**: Assign each philosopher a number and require them to pick up the lower-numbered chopstick first.
2. **Randomized Wait Time**: If unable to acquire both chopsticks, wait a random time before retrying.
3. **Centralized Manager**: A single entity (like a waiter) manages chopstick distribution.

*Instructor Insight*: "The problem with arbitrary ordering is determining who goes first in a symmetric environment."

##### Graph Representation of Deadlock
```
Thread 1 → holds lock A, wants lock B
Thread 2 → holds lock B, wants lock A
```

This creates a **circular dependency** that cannot be resolved.

---

#### Banker's Algorithm

A deadlock avoidance algorithm used to determine if it's safe to allocate resources without causing deadlock.

##### Key Concepts
- **Max**: Maximum resource requirements for each process.
- **Allocation**: Resources currently allocated to each process.
- **Need**: `Max - Allocation` (resources still needed).
- **Available**: Resources not currently allocated.

*Instructor Example*: "Imagine a castle siege where you need battering rams, ladders, knights, and flags. The algorithm helps determine if all sieges can be completed without deadlock."

##### Banker's Algorithm Steps
1. Set all processes as not ready.
2. Calculate `Need = Max - Allocation` for each process.
3. Find a runnable process where `Need ≤ Available`.
4. Run the process: `Available += Allocation`.
5. Repeat from step 3 until all processes are completed or no more can be run.

##### Example Calculation
| Process | Allocation (A B C D) | Max (A B C D) | Need (A B C D) |
|---------|----------------------|---------------|----------------|
| P0      | 0 0 1 2              | 0 0 1 2       | 0 0 0 0        |
| P1      | 1 0 0 0              | 1 7 5 0       | 0 7 5 0        |
| P2      | 1 3 5 4              | 2 3 5 6       | 1 0 0 2        |
| P3      | 0 6 3 2              | 0 6 5 2       | 0 0 2 0        |
| P4      | 0 0 1 4              | 0 6 5 6       | 0 6 4 2        |

*Available*: (1, 5, 2, 0)

**Step-by-Step Execution:**
1. **P0**: Need = (0,0,0,0) ≤ Available → Run P0
   - Update Available: (1+0, 5+0, 2+1, 0+2) = (1, 5, 3, 2)
2. **P2**: Need = (1,0,0,2) ≤ Available → Run P2
   - Update Available: (1+1, 5+3, 3+5, 2+4) = (2, 8, 8, 6)
3. **P3**: Need = (0,0,2,0) ≤ Available → Run P3
   - Update Available: (2+0, 8+6, 8+3, 6+2) = (2, 14, 11, 8)
4. **P4**: Need = (0,6,4,2) ≤ Available → Run P4
   - Update Available: (2+0, 14+0, 11+1, 8+4) = (2, 14, 12, 12)
5. **P1**: Need = (0,7,5,0) ≤ Available → Run P1

*Instructor Note*: "This is why it's called the 'Banker's Algorithm' - you're like a banker deciding whether to loan money based on your ability to repay."

#### Deadlock Prevention Strategies

##### 1. Eliminate Mutual Exclusion
- **Approach**: Use lock-free data structures with atomic operations.
- **Example**:
  ```c
  void add(int *val, int amt) {
      do {
          int old = *val;
      } while (!compare_and_swap(val, old, old + amt));
  }
  ```
  
*Instructor Insight*: "This avoids locks entirely by using atomic compare-and-swap operations."

##### 2. Eliminate Hold and Wait
- **Approach**: Use a meta-lock to acquire all needed resources at once.
- **Example**:
  ```c
  lock(&meta);
  lock(&A);
  lock(&B);
  // ... use A and B ...
  unlock(&B);
  unlock(&A);
  unlock(&meta);
  ```
  
*Instructor Note*: "This creates a bottleneck but eliminates circular wait."

##### 3. Add Preemption
- **Approach**: Allow processes to release resources if they can't acquire others.
- **Example**:
  ```c
  top:
      lock(A);
      if (try_lock(B) == -1) {
          unlock(A);
          goto top;
      }
  ```
  
*Instructor Clarification*: "This creates a livelock, where processes are constantly trying but making no progress."

##### 4. Eliminate Circular Wait
- **Approach**: Enforce strict ordering of resource acquisition.
- **Example**:
  ```c
  if (address(A) < address(B)) {
      lock(A);
      lock(B);
  } else {
      lock(B);
      lock(A);
  }
  ```
  
*Instructor Insight*: "This is the most reliable method for preventing deadlock in complex systems."

---

#### Livelock vs. Deadlock

| Feature | Deadlock | Livelock |
|---------|----------|----------|
| **State** | Processes are blocked and not making progress | Processes are active but not making progress |
| **Cause** | Circular wait with resources held indefinitely | Constant resource acquisition/releasing without progress |
| **Example** | Two people trying to pass through a narrow doorway, each waiting for the other to move | Traffic at an intersection where cars keep yielding to each other |

*Instructor Example*: "Livelock is like two drivers at a roundabout: 'You go first,' 'No, you go first,' and they just circle around without making progress."

---

### Summary

#### Key Takeaways
- **Semaphores** are stateful synchronization primitives with integer values representing available resources.
- Semaphores can implement mutexes (value = 1) and condition variables (with additional logic).
- The **bounded buffer problem** demonstrates semaphores' utility in producer-consumer scenarios.
- **Deadlock** requires four conditions: mutual exclusion, hold and wait, no preemption, circular wait.
- **Banker's algorithm** is a deadlock avoidance strategy that calculates safe resource allocation sequences.
- **Livelock** differs from deadlock as processes are active but making no progress.

#### Practical Applications
1. Semaphores for managing limited resources (e.g., database connections)
2. Banker's algorithm in operating system resource management
3. Deadlock prevention strategies in multi-threaded applications

---

### Study Questions

1. How does a semaphore differ from a mutex?
2. Why is the order of semaphore waits important in producer-consumer implementations?
3. What are the four necessary conditions for deadlock to occur?
4. Explain how Banker's algorithm determines if resource allocation is safe.
5. Describe two strategies for preventing deadlock and their trade-offs.
6. How would you implement a bounded buffer using semaphores? Provide code examples.
7. Why does the Therac-25 case study illustrate the importance of concurrency control?
8. What is livelock, and how does it differ from deadlock?
9. Explain why enforcing strict ordering of resource acquisition prevents circular wait.
10. How would you use a semaphore to implement a reader-writer lock?

---

### Practical Exercises

1. **Semaphore Implementation**: Write a complete implementation of semaphores using mutexes and condition variables.

2. **Deadlock Analysis**: Given the following resource allocation, determine if deadlock is possible:
   - Process A holds R1, wants R2
   - Process B holds R2, wants R1

3. **Banker's Algorithm Practice**: Apply Banker's algorithm to a new set of processes with different max and allocation values.

4. **Bounded Buffer Simulation**: Simulate the producer-consumer problem using semaphores in code (pseudocode is acceptable).

5. **Deadlock Prevention**: Design a system that uses strict ordering for resource acquisition to prevent deadlock.

# Week 6: Threads Bugs - Comprehensive Study Notes

<think>
Okay, I need to create comprehensive study notes based on a textbook chapter about "Threads Bugs" from Week 6. The user has provided all the slide content (Slides 1 through 16) and wants me to extract every concept, theory, example, case study with detailed explanations.

First, let's analyze what needs to be covered:
- All concepts: concurrency bugs types (atomicity violation, order violation), deadlock conditions
- Theories: Lu et al.'s bug analysis methodology, prevention techniques for deadlocks
- Principles: lock ordering strategies, trylock approach
- Examples: the MySQL atomicity example, Mozilla ordering bug, various deadlock fixes
- Case studies: MySQL/Apache/Mozilla/OpenOffice concurrency bugs from Figure 32.1

I notice this is a very detailed chapter with:
- Slide-specific content (Slide 1 to 16)
- Code snippets for examples and fixed versions
- References to academic papers ([L+08], [C+71] etc.)
- Homework questions at the end that I should incorporate as study questions

The user emphasized "DETAILED" so I'll need to:
- Explain each bug type with multiple angles (definition, cause, example, fix)
- Break down all four deadlock conditions thoroughly
- Cover every prevention technique in depth (lock ordering, trylock etc.)
- Include the Linux memory mapping lock order example from Slide 7

For structure planning:
1. Start with core concepts: what concurrency bugs are and why they matter
2. Present Lu et al.'s study findings first (Figure 32.1)
3. Deep dive into non-deadlock bugs (atomicity + order violations) 
   - Each needs its own subsection with code examples
4. Then deadlock section covering:
   - Conditions for deadlock
   - Prevention techniques (with all sub-methods)
   - Avoidance vs detection/recovery
5. Include the "Tom West's Law" as a key principle

Important to note: The homework questions at Slide 16 are actually great study questions I should include in my notes, but formatted properly.

For formatting:
- Use hierarchical headers (H2 for main sections, H3 for subsections)
- Bold all key terms like "atomicity violation", "circular wait"
- Create comparison tables where needed (e.g., deadlock conditions table)
- Preserve every code example with line-by-line explanations
- Add a comprehensive summary section at the end

I should be careful not to miss:
- The Linux memory mapping lock order example from Slide 7 ("imutex before immaprwsem" etc.)
- Herlihy's compare-and-swap examples for lock-free programming
- All references in Slide 15 (though I won't include full citations, just mention them as sources)

The most challenging part will be making the deadlock prevention techniques clear. Need to explain:
- Why total vs partial ordering matters
- How trylock avoids hold-and-wait but risks livelock
- The "address order" trick for lock acquisition

For study questions (15-20), I'll convert all homework questions into exam-style ones, adding some new critical thinking questions based on the content.

Let me start drafting with:

Then proceed section by section through each slide's content while maintaining strict adherence to "all examples and case studies" requirement.

# Week 6: Threads Bugs – Comprehensive Study Notes  
*Based on OSTEP Chapter 32 (Concurrency Bug Analysis)*  

---

### **I. Core Problem Statement**  
#### **CRUX**: *How to Handle Common Concurrency Bugs?*  
- Concurrency bugs manifest in predictable patterns; recognizing these is the first step toward writing robust concurrent code.  
- **Key Insight**: Most concurrency issues fall into two categories:  
  > ✅ **Non-deadlock bugs (74% of cases)** → Atomicity violations & order violations  
  > ⚠️ **Deadlock bugs (31%)**  

---

### **II. Lu et al.'s Bug Analysis Study [L+08]**  
*Quantitative analysis of concurrency bugs in real-world systems.*  

#### **Key Findings: Bug Distribution Across Applications**  
| Application      | What It Does               | Non-Deadlock Bugs | Deadlock Bugs | Total Concurrency Bugs |
|------------------|----------------------------|-------------------|---------------|------------------------|
| MySQL            | Database Server            | 14                | 9             | **23**                 |
| Apache           | Web Server                 | 13                | 4             | **17**                 |
| Mozilla          | Web Browser                | **41**            | **16**        | **57**                 |
| OpenOffice       | Office Suite               | 6                 | 2             | **8**                  |
| **TOTALS**       |                            | **74**            | **31**        | **105**                |

> 💡 **Why This Matters**:  
> - Non-deadlock bugs dominate (97% of non-deadlock cases are atomicity/order violations).  
> - Mozilla had the highest bug count due to complex concurrent operations.  

---

### **III. Non-Deadlock Bugs: Two Primary Types**  
#### **A. Atomicity Violation Bug**  
##### **Definition**:  
*Violation of intended serializability between multiple memory accesses (code region assumed atomic but not enforced during execution).*  

##### **Real Example from MySQL (`atomicity.c`)**  
```c
// Thread 1: 
if (thd->proc_info) {          // Check if non-NULL
    fputs(thd->proc_info, ...); // Print value → CRASH IF NULL!
}

// Thread 2:
thd->proc_info = NULL;         // Sets pointer to NULL
```
##### **Bug Cause**:  
1. Thread 1 checks `proc_info` (non-NULL), then *preempted*.  
2. Thread 2 sets `proc_info = NULL`.  
3. Thread 1 resumes → dereferences `NULL` in `fputs()`.  

##### **Fix: Enforce Atomicity with Locks (`atomicity_fixed.c`)**  
```c
pthread_mutex_t proc_info_lock = PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER;

// Thread 1:
pthread_mutex_lock(&proc_info_lock);
if (thd->proc_info) {
    fputs(thd->proc_info, ...); // Safe: lock held during access
}
pthread_mutex_unlock(&proc_info_lock);

// Thread 2:
pthread_mutex_lock(&proc_info_lock);
thd->proc_info = NULL;          // Safe: lock held during write
pthread_mutex_unlock(&proc_info_lock);
```
> 🔑 **Key Principle**: *All accesses to shared variables must be protected by a single mutual exclusion mechanism (e.g., mutex).*

---

#### **B. Order Violation Bug**  
##### **Definition**:  
*Desired order between memory accesses is flipped (A should execute before B, but execution order isn’t enforced).*  

##### **Real Example from Mozilla (`ordering.c`)**  
```c
// Thread 1: Initialization
void init() {
    mThread = PR_CreateThread(mMain, ...); // Sets mThread
}

// Thread 2: Uses mThread (assumes initialized)
void mMain(...) {
    mState = mThread->State; // CRASH IF mThread not set!
}
```
##### **Bug Cause**:  
- `mMain()` assumes `mThread` is non-NULL, but if it runs *before* initialization completes → dereferences NULL.  

##### **Fix: Enforce Order with Condition Variables (`ordering_fixed.c`)**  
```c
pthread_mutex_t mtLock = PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER;
pthread_cond_t mtCond = PTHREAD_COND_INITIALIZER;
int mtInit = 0; // State variable

// Thread 1 (Initialization):
void init() {
    ...
    mThread = PR_CreateThread(mMain, ...);
    
    pthread_mutex_lock(&mtLock);
    mtInit = 1;                  // Signal initialization complete
    pthread_cond_signal(&mtCond); 
    pthread_mutex_unlock(&mtLock);
}

// Thread 2 (Wait for initialization):
void mMain(...) {
    pthread_mutex_lock(&mtLock);
    while (!mtInit)               // Wait until initialized
        pthread_cond_wait(&mtCond, &mtLock);
    pthread_mutex_unlock(&mtLock);
    
    mState = mThread->State;      // Safe: mThread set!
}
```
> 🔑 **Key Principle**: *Use condition variables to enforce execution order between threads.*  

---

### **IV. Deadlock Bugs**  
#### **Definition**:  
*Two or more threads are blocked forever, each waiting for a resource held by another thread.*  

##### **Classic Example (`deadlock.c`)**  
```c
// Thread 1: 
pthread_mutex_lock(L1);
pthread_mutex_lock(L2); // Waits for L2 → but L2 held by T2

// Thread 2:
pthread_mutex_lock(L2);
pthread_mutex_lock(L1); // Waits for L1 → but L1 held by T1
```
##### **Dependency Graph (Figure 32.7)**  
```plaintext
Thread 1       Thread 2
Holds: L1      Holds: L2
Wants: L2      Wants: L1
→ Cycle in graph = DEADLOCK
```

---

#### **A. Four Conditions for Deadlock [C+71]**  
| Condition          | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Mutual Exclusion** | Threads claim exclusive control of resources (e.g., locks).                 |
| **Hold-and-Wait**    | Thread holds a lock while waiting for another.                              |
| **No Preemption**    | Resources cannot be forcibly taken from threads holding them.               |
| **Circular Wait**    | Circular chain exists: T1 → L1, T2 → L2, ..., Tn → Ln and back to T1.     |

> ⚠️ *If ANY condition fails, deadlock CANNOT occur.*

---

#### **B. Deadlock Prevention Techniques**  
##### **1. Prevent Circular Wait (Most Practical)**  
- **Total Ordering**: Acquire locks in a fixed global order (e.g., always `L1` before `L2`).  
  ```c
  // Safe: Always acquire L1 then L2
  pthread_mutex_lock(L1);
  pthread_mutex_lock(L2); 
  ```
- **Partial Ordering**: Use hierarchical lock groups (e.g., "imutex" → "immaprwsem").  
  > 💡 *Linux Memory Mapping Example*:  
  > `v5.2` kernel uses ordered lock acquisition:  
  > `"imutex before immaprwsem, immaprwsem before private_lock..."`  

- **Lock Address Ordering (Smart Trick!)**:  
  ```c
  if (m1 > m2) { // High-to-low address order
      pthread_mutex_lock(m1);
      pthread_mutex_lock(m2);
  } else {
      pthread_mutex_lock(m2);
      pthread_mutex_lock(m1);
  }
  ```
  → *Guarantees consistent lock acquisition regardless of input order.*  

##### **2. Prevent Hold-and-Wait**  
- Acquire all locks at once (atomically):  
  ```c
  pthread_mutex_lock(prevention); // Global "prevention" lock
  pthread_mutex_lock(L1);
  pthread_mutex_lock(L2);
  ... 
  pthread_mutex_unlock(prevention);
  ```
> ❌ **Drawback**: Reduces concurrency; requires knowing all locks upfront.  

##### **3. Avoid Mutual Exclusion (Lock-Free Programming)**  
- Use hardware instructions like `compare-and-swap` to avoid explicit locking:  
  ```c
  int CompareAndSwap(int *address, int expected, int new) {
      if (*address == expected) { 
          *address = new; return 1;
      }
      return 0;
  }

  // Atomic increment (no lock needed!)
  void AtomicIncrement(int *value, int amount) {
      do {
          int old = *value;
      } while (CompareAndSwap(value, old, old + amount) == 0);
  }
  ```

- **Lock-Free List Insertion Example**:  
  ```c
  void insert(int value) {
      node_t* n = malloc(...); 
      n->value = value;
      
      do {
          n->next = head; // Point to current head
      } while (CompareAndSwap(&head, n->next, n) == 0);
  }
  ```
> 🔑 **Why It Works**:  
> - If another thread updates `head`, the CAS fails → retry with new value.  
> - *No deadlock possible* (but livelock risk remains).  

##### **4. Avoid No Preemption**  
- Use `pthread_mutex_trylock()` to avoid blocking:  
  ```c
  top:
      pthread_mutex_lock(L1);
      if (pthread_mutex_trylock(L2) != 0) {
          pthread_mutex_unlock(L1); 
          goto top; // Retry without holding L1
      }
  ```
> ⚠️ **Risk**: *Livelock* → threads repeatedly fail to acquire locks but make no progress.  
> ✅ **Fix Livelihood**: Add random delay before retrying (e.g., `usleep(10)`).  

---

#### **C. Deadlock Avoidance via Scheduling**  
- Requires global knowledge of lock demands per thread.  
- *Example*: Schedule threads to avoid concurrent acquisition of circular locks:  
  | Thread | Locks Needed |
  |--------|--------------|
  | T1     | L1, L2       |
  | T2     | L1, L2       |
  | T3     | L2           |
  | **Schedule**: CPU1 = [T1], CPU2 = [T2] → *No deadlock* (T1/T2 never run together).  

> ⚠️ **Drawback**: Limits concurrency; impractical for large systems.  
> 💡 *Dijkstra’s Banker’s Algorithm*: Used in embedded systems with full task knowledge, but rare in practice.  

---

#### **D. Detect and Recover**  
- Run deadlock detector periodically (e.g., check resource graphs for cycles).  
- If cycle detected:  
  - Terminate one thread → release its locks.  
  - *Example*: Database systems reboot or restart transactions on detection.  
> ✅ **When to Use**: When deadlocks are rare and recovery cost is low (e.g., OS reboots once yearly).  

---

### **V. Key Principles & Wisdom**  
#### **Tom West’s Law [K81]**:  
> *“Not everything worth doing is worth doing well.”*  
- Apply to concurrency bugs: If a bug occurs rarely and has low cost, don’t over-engineer fixes.  
- ⚠️ *Exception*: Critical systems (e.g., space shuttle) require perfect solutions.  

#### **Why Deadlocks Are Inevitable in Large Systems**:  
1. **Complex Dependencies** → e.g., Virtual memory system needs file system access to page data, which requires virtual memory again.  
2. **Encapsulation Issues** → Hidden locking protocols (e.g., Java `Vector.AddAll()`) cause hidden deadlocks:  
   ```java
   v1.AddAll(v2); // Acquires locks on v1 then v2
   v2.AddAll(v1); // Could deadlock if run concurrently!
   ```

---

### **VI. Summary of Bug Patterns**  

| Bug Type               | Cause                                  | Fix Strategy                          |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Atomicity Violation** | Check + use shared variable not atomic | Add mutex around all accesses         |
| **Order Violation**     | Execution order flipped                | Use condition variables for ordering  |
| **Deadlock (Circular)** | Circular lock dependency               | Enforce total/partial lock ordering   |

> 💡 **Most Effective Strategy**: *Prevent deadlock via strict lock acquisition orders.*  
> 🌐 **Emerging Trend**: Lock-free data structures (e.g., in Linux) for critical sections.  

---

### **VII. Study Questions**  
*(15-20 Exam-Focused Questions)*  

1. What percentage of non-deadlock bugs are atomicity or order violations? How does this inform debugging priorities?  
2. In the MySQL `atomicity.c` example, why is a NULL pointer dereference caused by thread preemption? Explain step-by-step.  
3. Describe *two* ways to fix an order violation bug (beyond condition variables). What are their trade-offs?  
4. Why does using lock address ordering prevent deadlock in functions like `dosomething(mutex_t*m1, mutex_t*m2)`?  
5. List all four conditions for deadlock and explain how preventing one breaks the cycle.  
6. How would you modify a database transaction to avoid hold-and-wait without global knowledge of locks? (Hint: Use trylock + retry)  
7. Why is `pthread_mutex_trylock()` not true preemption, but still useful? What new problem does it introduce?  
8. In the lock-free list insertion example (`insert`), what happens if two threads call `insert()` simultaneously? Trace a possible execution path.  
9. How does Linux’s memory mapping code (Slide 7) use partial ordering to avoid deadlock? Give an explicit order from their comments.  
10. Why is it dangerous to assume the same lock acquisition order across all functions in large systems? Provide a real-world example.  
11. What would happen if `mThread` was not initialized as NULL in Mozilla’s ordering bug? How could this cause *worse* issues than a crash?  
12. Explain why deadlock avoidance via scheduling (e.g., Dijkstra) is impractical for general-purpose OSes but useful in embedded systems.  
13. Compare the performance of `vector-global-order.c` vs. `vector-try-wait.c` when increasing thread count. Why does one scale better?  
14. How would you detect a livelock (vs. deadlock) in concurrent code, and what is its impact on system throughput?  
15. In the homework question 9 (`vector-nolock.c`), why might this version *not* provide identical semantics to locked versions for vector addition? Give an example scenario.  
16. Why does Herlihy’s lock-free list insertion require a `do-while` loop with CAS instead of simple locking? What would happen without retries?  
17. How do encapsulation and modular design contribute *to* deadlock (not just prevent it)? Use Java Vector as an example.  
18. If you were to implement a new concurrent data structure, which approach would you prioritize: lock ordering or lock-free programming? Justify with cost/benefit analysis.  
19. What is the key difference between "wait-free" and "lock-free" synchronization (per Herlihy [H93])? Why is wait-free harder to implement?  
20. How does Tom West’s Law apply specifically to concurrency bug fixes in a commercial product with tight deadlines?

### X. Summary, Key Takeaways, and Study Questions

Now I'll develop each section with comprehensive detail based on the slides.

Let me go through all 20 slides carefully to extract every concept:

Slide 1: Introduces semaphores as a synchronization primitive invented by Dijkstra (D68b, D72). Semaphores can be used for both locks and condition variables. The key question is "How to use semaphores instead of locks and condition variables?"

Slide 2: Defines semaphore with integer value manipulated via two routines - semwait() and sempost(). Shows initialization example (sem_init(&s, 0, 1)). Explains the behavior:
- sem_wait(): decrement by one; wait if negative
- sem_post(): increment by one; wake a waiting thread

Slide 3: Demonstrates using semaphore as binary lock. Initial value should be 1 for a lock.

Slides 4-5: Further explain how to use semaphores as locks with examples and traces showing two threads trying to acquire the same lock.

Slide 6: Introduces using semaphores for ordering events (parent waiting for child). Shows initialization of semaphore to 0 in this case, not 1 like a lock. Explains why value should be 0 - because nothing is available at start; it's created when child finishes.

Slides 7-8: Discuss the producer/consumer problem with bounded buffer solution using two semaphores (empty and full). Shows code for put/get routines and initial implementation attempt.

Slide 9: Identifies a race condition in the first attempt to solve producer/consumer. Explains why it happens when MAX > 1 - multiple producers can overwrite each other's data before incrementing fill counter.

Slides 10-11: Discusses adding mutual exclusion (locks) but shows an incorrect implementation that causes deadlock, then provides a correct solution by moving the mutex around only the critical section of put() and get(), not surrounding all operations.

Slide 12: Introduces reader-writer locks. Shows code for rwlock_t structure with semaphores lock and writelock, plus readers counter. Explains how read locks work (first reader acquires write lock), while writers wait until no readers are present.

Slides 13-14: Discusses Hill's Law - "Simple and dumb can be better" in locking approaches. Mentions that sometimes simple spinlocks outperform more complex solutions like reader-writer locks.

Slide 15: Introduces the dining philosophers problem (Dijkstra, D71). Shows a broken solution where each philosopher grabs left fork first then right fork, leading to deadlock when all grab their left forks simultaneously.

Slides 16-18: Presents a corrected solution for dining philosophers by having one philosopher grab forks in reverse order. Discusses other concurrency problems like cigarette smokers and sleeping barber problem as examples of fun but not particularly practical concurrency puzzles.

Slide 17: Introduces thread throttling - using semaphores to limit concurrent execution (admission control). Example given is memory-intensive regions where too many threads could cause thrashing.

Slides 18-20: Discusses implementing semaphores with locks and condition variables ("Zemaphores"), the difficulty of building condition variables from semaphores, references for further reading, and homework problems to practice these concepts.

Now I'll create comprehensive study notes based on this analysis.

# Comprehensive Study Notes: Threads Semaphores (Week 6)

### Introduction to Semaphores
#### Historical Context & Definition

**Semaphores**, introduced by **Edsger Dijkstra** in his seminal papers [D68b, D72], are a fundamental synchronization primitive that can be used for both locks and condition variables. The key insight is that semaphores provide a unified mechanism to solve various concurrency problems.

- **Historical Note**: Originally called `P()` (from Dutch "probeer" - try) and `V()` (from Dutch "verhoog" - increase), later renamed to `sem_wait`/`sem_post`.
  - Dijkstra's original interpretation: P() from "passering" (to pass) and V() from "vrijgave" (release)
  - Later reinterpretation by Dijkstra: P() from "prolaag" ("try" + "decrease") and V() from "verhoog" ("increase")

**Definition**: A semaphore is an object with an integer value that can be manipulated using two routines:
- `sem_wait()` (also called **P()**, down)
- `sem_post()` (also called **V()**, up)

The behavior of these operations, as defined in Figure 31.2:

| Operation | Behavior |
|-----------|----------|
| `sem_wait(sem_t *s)` | Decrement semaphore value by one; if negative, wait until non-negative |
| `sem_post(sem_t *s)` | Increment semaphore value by one; wake up a waiting thread (if any) |

**Key Invariant**: When the semaphore's value is **negative**, its absolute value equals the number of threads currently waiting on it.

### Semaphore Operations & Behavior
#### Core Principles

1. **Atomicity Requirement**: All operations (`sem_wait`, `sem_post`) must be performed atomically to prevent race conditions within the semaphore implementation itself.
   
2. **Semantics**:
   - A thread calling `sem_wait()` will either return immediately (if value ≥ 0) or block until another thread calls `sem_post()`.
   - `sem_post()` never blocks; it simply increments the count and wakes a waiting thread if one exists.

3. **Initialization**: Semaphores must be initialized before use with an initial integer value:
   ```c
   sem_init(&s, 0, 1); // Initialize to 1 (binary semaphore)
   ```
   - Second argument: `0` means shared between threads in the same process.
   - Third argument: Initial value of the semaphore.

#### Semaphores vs. Locks & Condition Variables

| Primitive | Purpose | Can Be Built From |
|-----------|---------|-------------------|
| **Lock** | Mutual exclusion for critical sections | Binary semaphore (initialized to 1) |
| **Condition Variable** | Wait for specific conditions | Semaphore with additional state tracking |

Dijkstra's insight: Semaphores can replace both locks and condition variables, making them a more fundamental primitive.

### Using Semaphores as Locks
#### Binary Semaphores

A binary semaphore (initialized to 1) functions exactly like a lock. The code structure is:

```c
sem_t m;
sem_init(&m, 0, 1); // Initialize to 1 for locking

// Critical section:
sem_wait(&m);
// ... critical section ...
sem_post(&m);
```

#### Thread Trace Analysis (Single Thread)

| Value | Thread 0 State |
|-------|----------------|
| 1     | Run            |
| 1     | call semwait() |
| 0     | semwait() returns |
| 0     | (crit sect)    |
| 0     | call sempost() |
| 1     | sempost() returns |

#### Thread Trace Analysis (Two Threads)

When two threads compete for a lock:

| Value | Thread 0 State      | Thread 1 State       |
|-------|---------------------|----------------------|
| 1     | Run                 | Ready                |
| 1     | call semwait()      | Ready                |
| 0     | semwait() returns   | Ready                |
| 0     | (crit sect begin)   | Ready                |
| 0     | Interrupt; Switch →T1 | Sleep              |
| -1    | Ready               | call semwait()       |
| -1    | Ready               | decr sem             |
| -1    | Ready               | (sem<0)→sleep        |
| -1    | Run                 | Sleep                |

**Why it works**: The initial value of 1 ensures that the first thread can acquire the lock immediately. Subsequent threads will block when trying to decrement from 0.

### Semaphores for Ordering Events
#### Parent-Child Synchronization

Example: A parent thread waiting for a child thread to complete execution:

```c
sem_t s;
// Initialize with value 0 (nothing available at start)
sem_init(&s, 0, 0);

printf("parent: begin\n");
pthread_create(&c, NULL, child, NULL);
sem_wait(&s); // Wait until child signals completion
printf("parent: end\n");

void*child(void *arg) {
    printf("child\n");
    sem_post(&s); // Signal parent that we're done
}
```

**Why initialize to 0?**: The semaphore starts with value 0 because nothing is available at the beginning (the child hasn't completed yet).

#### Two Scenarios for Parent-Child Synchronization

1. **Parent runs first, then creates and waits for child:**
   - Value becomes `-1` when parent calls `sem_wait()`
   - Child completes work → increments to 0
   - Parent wakes up from waiting state

2. **Child runs immediately after creation (before parent can wait):**
   - Child executes `sem_post()` first, incrementing value to 1
   - Parent then calls `sem_wait()` and decrements to 0 without blocking

**General Rule for Initialization**: Consider the number of resources available *immediately* after initialization:
- For a lock: Initialize with **1** (one resource immediately available)
- For ordering events like parent-child: Initialize with **0** (no resources initially)

### Producer/Consumer Problem
#### First Attempt at Solution

The bounded buffer problem requires coordination between producers and consumers:

```c
sem_t empty; // Tracks number of empty slots in buffer
sem_t full;  // Tracks number of filled slots in buffer

void*producer(void *arg) {
    for (i = 0; i < loops; i++) {
        sem_wait(&empty);   // Wait until a slot is available
        put(i);             // Put data into the buffer
        sem_post(&full);    // Signal that a slot has been filled
    }
}

void*consumer(void *arg) {
    while (tmp != -1) {
        sem_wait(&full);     // Wait until there's something to consume
        tmp = get();         // Get data from the buffer
        sem_post(&empty);    // Signal that a slot is now empty
        printf("%d\n", tmp);
    }
}
```

**Initialization**: 
```c
sem_init(&empty, 0, MAX);   // All slots initially available (MAX)
sem_init(&full, 0, 0);      // No filled slots at start
```

#### Race Condition in First Attempt

When `MAX > 1`, a race condition occurs because:
- Multiple producers can simultaneously access the buffer.
- If two producers call `put()` concurrently before incrementing `fill` counter:
  - Producer A writes to index 0 (before updating fill)
  - Producer B overwrites producer A's data at index 0
  - Data loss: The first producer's value is lost

#### Correct Implementation with Mutual Exclusion

**Incorrect Approach**: Adding mutex around all operations:

```c
sem_wait(&mutex); // Incorrectly placed before sem_wait()
sem_wait(&empty);
put(i);
sem_post(&full);
sem_post(&mutex);
```

This causes **deadlock**:
- Consumer holds `mutex` and waits for `full`
- Producer tries to acquire `mutex` but is blocked

**Correct Approach**: Restrict mutex only around the critical section:

```c
void*producer(void *arg) {
    for (i = 0; i < loops; i++) {
        sem_wait(&empty); // Wait until slot available
        sem_wait(&mutex); // Acquire lock for buffer access
        put(i);
        sem_post(&mutex); // Release lock after critical section
        sem_post(&full);  // Signal that a slot is filled
    }
}
```

**Why it works**: The mutex only protects the `put()` operation (the critical section), while semaphore operations (`sem_wait`/`sem_post`) handle coordination between threads.

### Reader-Writer Locks
#### Conceptual Overview

Reader-writer locks allow multiple readers to access a data structure concurrently, but ensure exclusive write access for writers. This improves concurrency when reads are more frequent than writes.

**Key Components in `rwlock_t` Structure:**
```c
typedef struct _rwlock_t {
    sem_t lock;        // Binary semaphore (basic lock)
    sem_t writelock;   // Allow ONE writer/MANY readers
    int readers;       // #readers currently inside critical section
} rwlock_t;
```

#### Read Lock Acquisition (`rwlock_acquire_readlock`)

1. Acquire basic `lock`
2. Increment reader count
3. **If first reader** (count == 1):
   - Acquire write lock via `sem_wait(&writelock)`
4. Release the basic lock

This ensures that when a writer wants to acquire the lock, it must wait until all readers have finished.

#### Write Lock Acquisition (`rwlock_acquire_writelock`)

```c
void rwlock_acquire_writelock(rwlock_t *rw) {
    sem_wait(&rw->writelock); // Wait for write access (only one writer)
}
```

**Why it works**: The first reader acquires the `writelock`, preventing writers from entering. When all readers exit, they release the `writelock` via `sem_post()`, allowing a waiting writer to proceed.

#### Limitations & Hill's Law

- **Hill's Law (Simple and Dumb Can Be Better)**: "Big and dumb is better" - simple solutions often outperform complex ones.
  > *Example*: Simple spin locks may be faster than sophisticated reader-writer locks due to lower overhead.

- **Starvation Risk**: Readers can starve writers if many readers are constantly accessing the data structure. More advanced implementations would need mechanisms to prevent this (e.g., prioritizing waiting writers).

### Dining Philosophers Problem
#### Classic Setup

5 philosophers sitting around a table, each with one fork between them:
- Each philosopher alternates between thinking and eating.
- To eat, needs both left and right forks.

**Problem**: Avoid deadlock where all philosophers pick up their left fork but wait for the right (which is held by another).

#### Broken Solution Analysis

```c
void get_forks(int p) {
    sem_wait(&forks[left(p)]);  // Left fork
    sem_wait(&forks[right(p)]); // Right fork
}

void put_forks(int p) {
    sem_post(&forks[left(p)]);
    sem_post(&forks[right(p)]);
}
```

**Why it fails**: If all philosophers pick up their left forks first, they'll be stuck waiting for the right fork (which is held by another philosopher), causing **deadlock**.

#### Corrected Solution

Break the circular wait condition:
```c
void get_forks(int p) {
    if (p == 4) { // Philosopher 4 gets right then left
        sem_wait(&forks[right(p)]);
        sem_wait(&forks[left(p)]);
    } else {      // Others get left then right
        sem_wait(&forks[left(p)]);
        sem_wait(&forks[right(p)]);
    }
}
```

**Why it works**: Philosopher 4 (the highest-numbered) acquires forks in reverse order, breaking the circular dependency. This prevents all philosophers from holding one fork while waiting for another.

### Thread Throttling with Semaphores
#### Concept of Admission Control

Semaphores can limit concurrent execution to prevent resource exhaustion:
- **Throttling**: Limiting how many threads execute a specific region at once.
- **Admission control**: Regulating access based on system capacity.

**Example Use Case**: Memory-intensive operations where too many threads could cause thrashing (excessive disk swapping).

#### Implementation

```c
sem_t memory_sem;
int max_threads = 4; // Maximum concurrent threads in critical section

// Initialize semaphore to the maximum number of allowed threads
sem_init(&memory_sem, 0, max_threads);

void compute() {
    sem_wait(&memory_sem);      // Wait if at capacity
    
    // Memory-intensive operation here...
    
    sem_post(&memory_sem);      // Release slot for others
}
```

**How it works**: The semaphore starts with value `max_threads`. Each thread must acquire a "slot" before entering the memory-intensive region. When all slots are taken, new threads block until one releases its slot.

### Implementing Semaphores Using Locks & Condition Variables (Zemaphores)
#### Zemaphore Implementation

```c
typedef struct __Zem_t {
    int value;
    pthread_cond_t cond;  // Condition variable for waiting threads
    pthread_mutex_t lock; // Mutex to protect state
} Zem_t;

void Zem_init(Zem_t *s, int value) {
    s->value = value;
    Cond_init(&s->cond);
    Mutex_init(&s->lock);
}

void Zem_wait(Zem_t *s) {
    Mutex_lock(&s->lock);
    while (s->value <= 0)
        Cond_wait(&s->cond, &s->lock); // Wait until positive
    s->value--;
    Mutex_unlock(&s->lock);
}

void Zem_post(Zem_t *s) {
    Mutex_lock(&s->lock);
    s->value++;
    Cond_signal(&s->cond);  // Wake one waiting thread if any
    Mutex_unlock(&s->lock);
}
```

#### Key Differences from Standard Semaphores

| Feature | Standard Semaphore | Zemaphore |
|---------|--------------------|-----------|
| **Negative Value** | Reflects number of waiting threads (value = -waiting) | Never negative; value ≥ 0 always |
| **Condition Variable Usage** | Not required for implementation | Uses condition variable internally |

#### Why Building Condition Variables from Semaphores is Hard

- Dijkstra's insight: While semaphores can implement locks and condition variables, the reverse isn't straightforward.
- **Challenge**: A condition variable requires signaling only when a specific condition changes (not just any thread waking up).
- **Consequence**: Early attempts to build CVs on top of semaphores led to subtle bugs in systems like Windows [B04].

### Summary & Key Takeaways

#### Core Principles
1. Semaphores are the fundamental synchronization primitive that can replace both locks and condition variables.
2. The initial value determines whether a semaphore is used as:
   - **Lock**: Initialize with `1` (one resource immediately available)
   - **Ordering Primitive**: Initialize with `0` (no resources initially)

3. Critical to understand when semaphores are being misused for ordering vs. mutual exclusion.

#### Common Patterns
| Pattern | Semaphore Initialization | Key Operations |
|---------|--------------------------|---------------|
| Lock    | 1                        | Wait before critical section, post after |
| Ordering | 0                       | Parent waits (sem_wait), child signals (sem_post) |
| Bounded Buffer | empty=MAX, full=0 | Producers wait on `empty`, signal `full`; Consumers wait on `full`, signal `empty` |

#### Important Considerations
- **Deadlock**: Can occur when acquiring multiple semaphores in inconsistent order.
- **Starvation**: Readers can starve writers; more sophisticated solutions needed for fairness.
- **Hill's Law**: Simple and dumb approaches (like basic locks) often outperform complex ones.

### Comprehensive Reference Table: Semaphore Usage Patterns

| Pattern | Initialization Value | Key Operations | Purpose |
|---------|----------------------|---------------|---------|
| **Lock (Binary)** | 1 | `sem_wait()` before CS; `sem_post()` after CS | Mutual exclusion for critical sections |
| **Parent-Child Sync** | 0 | Parent: `sem_wait()`, Child: `sem_post()` | Wait until child completes execution |
| **Bounded Buffer - Empty Slots** | MAX (buffer size) | Producer: `wait(empty)` before put; Consumer: `post(empty)` after get | Track available buffer slots for producers |
| **Bounded Buffer - Full Slots** | 0 | Producer: `post(full)` after put; Consumer: `wait(full)` before get | Track filled buffer slots for consumers |
| **Reader-Writer Lock (Read)** | N/A (internal) | First reader acquires write lock via `sem_wait(writelock)` | Allow multiple readers while preventing writers |
| **Thread Throttling** | Max allowed concurrent threads | `wait()` at entry; `post()` after critical section | Limit resource usage to prevent thrashing |

### Final Exam Preparation Tips

1. **Understand the Invariant**: Remember that when a semaphore's value is negative, its absolute value equals the number of waiting threads.

2. **Initialization Matters**: Always consider what you're trying to achieve:
   - For locks: Initialize with 1
   - For ordering events (like parent-child): Initialize with 0

3. **Trace Thread Execution**: Practice tracing thread execution through semaphore operations using tables like those in the slides, especially for two-thread scenarios.

4. **Recognize Common Patterns**:
   - Producer/consumer pattern uses two semaphores (`empty` and `full`)
   - Reader-writer locks use a combination of read/write counters with semaphores
   - Dining philosophers requires breaking circular wait

5. **Know the Limitations**: Be prepared to explain why certain approaches fail (deadlock, race conditions) and how they can be fixed.

6. **Understand Implementation Tradeoffs**: Know when simple solutions are better than complex ones (Hill's Law).

7. **Be Able to Write Code**: Practice implementing common patterns like bounded buffer with correct mutual exclusion around critical sections only.

This comprehensive set of notes covers all concepts, examples, and principles from the textbook chapter on semaphores in detail, providing a complete foundation for exam preparation and deep understanding of concurrency primitives.
