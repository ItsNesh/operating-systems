Okay, the user wants me to create concise study notes from a textbook chapter about CPU scheduling. They've provided detailed slides with explanations of various scheduling algorithms and concepts.

Looking at this material, I need to extract only the most essential information for exam preparation. The key is to focus on core concepts like FIFO, SJF, STCF, RR, and their trade-offs - while eliminating all redundant examples and verbose text.

Hmm... the textbook covers several important points:
- Workload assumptions (though unrealistic)
- Scheduling metrics: turnaround time vs response time
- Algorithms: FIFO → SJF/STCF → Round Robin
- The critical trade-off between throughput and interactivity

I should organize this into clear categories. Let me identify exactly what students need to know for exams:

First, the two main scheduling goals:
1) Minimize average **turnaround time** (total job completion time)
2) Minimize **response time** (time until first CPU allocation)

Then the algorithms that optimize each:
- For turnaround: **SJF/STCF** (shortest jobs first/preemptive version)
- For response: **Round Robin** with small time slices

Must include the critical trade-off concept - you can't maximize both simultaneously. The textbook uses great examples like grocery store lines to illustrate this.

Also need to cover:
- Why FIFO fails with long jobs (convoy effect example)
- How STCF handles late arrivals better than SJF
- Impact of I/O on scheduling (CPU bursts vs waiting)

The references and homework are less important for quick review, so I'll skip those. The "easy pieces" tips can be condensed into key takeaways.

For structure:
- Start with core metrics table (turnaround vs response)
- Then algorithm comparison in a simple format
- Highlight the unavoidable trade-off as main takeaway

Must keep it ultra-concise - target 30% of original length. Will avoid all examples except one killer illustration: the "100s job blocking two 10s jobs" for FIFO failure.

Also need to define key terms simply:
- Turnaround time = completion - arrival
- Response time = first run start - arrival

The STCF vs SJF distinction is crucial (preemptive vs non-preemptive), and the textbook emphasizes that STCF is optimal when arrivals are staggered.

For RR, must mention the time slice trade-off: too short → high context switch cost; too long → poor response times. The amortization tip about making slices longer to reduce switching overhead is worth including briefly.

I'll skip all historical references (like Cobham 1954) and focus only on concepts applicable to modern OS scheduling.

The summary box at the end should capture everything in one glance - that's what students will actually use for last-minute review.

# CPU Scheduling: Core Concepts  
*Focused study notes for exam preparation*

## 🔑 **Key Metrics**  
| Metric             | Definition                                  | Goal                          |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Turnaround Time** | `Completion time - Arrival time`            | Minimize (total job completion) |
| **Response Time**   | `First CPU run start - Arrival time`        | Minimize (interactivity)       |

> 💡 *Trade-off: Optimizing one metric worsens the other. Fairness often conflicts with performance.*

## ⚙️ **Core Scheduling Algorithms**

### 1. **FIFO / FCFS**  
- **How it works**: Run jobs in arrival order (non-preemptive).  
- ✅ *Pros*: Simple, easy to implement.  
- ❌ *Cons*: **Convoy effect** with long jobs blocking short ones:  
  > Example: Long job (100s) blocks two short jobs (10s each) → Avg turnaround = `110s` vs optimal `50s`.  

---

### 2. **SJF / STCF**  
| Type       | Preemptive? | Optimizes      | Best For               |
|------------|-------------|----------------|------------------------|
| **SJF**    | ❌ No        | Turnaround     | Batch systems (known job lengths) |
| **STCF**   | ✅ Yes       | Turnaround*    | Dynamic arrivals (optimal if known runtimes) |

> 💡 *Why STCF > SJF?*: Handles late-arriving short jobs by preempting long ones.  
> Example: Jobs A(100s), B/C(10s each, arrive at t=10):  
> - **STCF**: Runs B/C first → Avg turnaround = `50s` (vs SJF’s `103.3s`).  

---

### 3. **Round Robin (RR)**  
- **How it works**: Time-slice (`quantum`) per job; cycles through ready queue.  
- ✅ *Pros*: Excellent for **response time** (fair, interactive systems).  
- ❌ *Cons*: Poor for **turnaround time** (stretches jobs unnecessarily).  

> ⚖️ **Time Slice Trade-off**:  
> - Too short → High context-switch cost (`10%` overhead at 10ms slice).  
> - Too long → Degraded response time.  
> *Optimal*: Balance to amortize switch costs (e.g., `10-100ms`).  

---

## 🔄 **Critical Trade-offs & Realism**  
| Goal                | Algorithm   | Assumption Needed      | Reality Check               |
|---------------------|-------------|------------------------|----------------------------|
| Minimize turnaround | SJF/STCF    | Known job lengths      | ❌ Unachievable (OS can’t predict) |
| Minimize response   | RR          | Short time slices      | ✅ Practical for interactive systems |

> 💡 **I/O Handling**:  
> - Treat CPU bursts as independent jobs → Overlap I/O with other work.  
> *Example*: Job A (CPU 10ms + I/O 10ms) runs while B uses CPU → Better utilization.

---

## 📌 **Exam Essentials**  
1. **STCF is optimal for turnaround time** under dynamic arrivals (*if runtimes known*).  
2. **RR minimizes response time but maximizes turnaround** (worst-case: `N × quantum`).  
3. **Convoy effect**: Long jobs block short ones → Avoid with SJF/STCF.  
4. **I/O-bound vs CPU-bound**: Schedulers must prioritize I/O completion to avoid idle CPU.  

> 🚫 *Never assume*: "Job runtimes are known" (real OSes use prediction, e.g., multi-level feedback queues).

## ✅ **Summary Box: The Core Conflict**  
| Metric          | Best Algorithm | Why?                          |
|-----------------|----------------|-------------------------------|
| Turnaround Time | STCF           | Runs shortest jobs first      |
| Response Time   | RR             | Short time slices for fairness |

> 💡 *Remember*: "You can’t have your cake and eat it too" → **Optimize one metric, sacrifice the other.**  
> *(e.g., SJF = fast batch processing; RR = responsive terminals)*
