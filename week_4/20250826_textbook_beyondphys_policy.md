I need to create comprehensive study notes based on the provided textbook chapter about virtual memory replacement policies. I'll follow all instructions carefully.

Let me break down what needs to be included:

1. **Extract ALL Concepts**: Identify and explain every concept from the text.
2. **Detailed Explanations**: Provide thorough explanations of all topics.
3. **Complete Vocabulary**: Define important terms with full context.
4. **All Examples**: Include every example with detailed explanations.
5. **Deep Understanding**: Focus on complete mastery.

I'll organize this using hierarchical headers, bold key terms, use tables for comparisons, include formulas and processes, add comprehensive summaries, and create 15-20 study questions.

Let me start by identifying all the major concepts from the chapter:

**Major Concepts:**
- Virtual memory management
- Page replacement policies (FIFO, LRU, Random, Optimal)
- Cache misses vs. hits
- Average Memory Access Time (AMAT) formula
- Belady's optimal policy
- Types of cache misses (compulsory, capacity, conflict)
- Belady's anomaly with FIFO
- Locality principle (spatial and temporal locality)
- Clock algorithm for approximating LRU
- Dirty pages consideration in replacement policies
- Page selection/prefetching policies
- Thrashing

Now I'll create a structured outline of the study notes:

# Beyond Physical Memory: Policies - Comprehensive Study Notes

## 1. Introduction to Virtual Memory Replacement Policy

### Key Concept: The Core Problem
When physical memory is scarce, OS must decide which page(s) to evict from RAM when new pages need to be loaded.

**The Crux**: How to decide which page to evict?

This decision is made by the **replacement policy**, usually following general principles but with tweaks for corner cases.

## 2. Cache Management Fundamentals

### Key Concept: Virtual Memory as a Cache
Main memory holds some subset of all pages in system → can be viewed as cache for virtual memory pages.

**Goal**: Minimize number of cache misses (page faults) or maximize cache hits.

#### Average Memory Access Time (AMAT)
Formula:
```
AMAT = TM + (PMiss · TD)
```

Where:
- `TM` = cost of accessing main memory
- `TD` = cost of accessing disk
- `PMiss` = probability of miss (0.0 to 1.0)

**Example Calculation:**
- Memory access time (`TM`) = 100 ns
- Disk access time (`TD`) = 10 ms = 10,000,000 ns
- Miss rate (`PMiss`) = 0.1 (10%)
  
AMAT = 100 + (0.1 × 10,000,000) = 100 + 1,000,000 = 1,000,100 ns ≈ 1 ms

**Key Insight**: Disk access is so expensive that even a small miss rate dominates AMAT. A hit rate of 99.9% (PMiss=0.001) gives:
AMAT = 100 + (0.001 × 10,000,000) = 100 + 10,000 = 10,100 ns ≈ 10 microseconds

## 3. The Optimal Replacement Policy

### Key Concept: Belady's MIN Algorithm
- Proposed by Laszlo A. Belady in 1966 [B66]
- Replaces the page that will be accessed furthest in the future (minimizes misses)
- **Optimal** but not implementable for general-purpose OS

#### Why it works:
If you must evict a page, choose one needed farthest in the future. This ensures pages more likely to be used soon remain in memory.

### Example: Optimal Policy Tracing
Reference stream: 0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 3, 0, 3, 1, 2, 1 (cache size = 3)

| Access | Hit/Miss? | Evict | Cache State |
|--------|-----------|-------|-------------|
| 0      | Miss      |       | [0]         |
| 1      | Miss      |       | [0, 1]      |
| 2      | Miss      |       | [0, 1, 2]   |
| 0      | Hit       |       | [0, 1, 2]   |
| 1      | Hit       |       | [0, 1, 2]   |
| 3      | Miss      | 2     | [0, 1, 3]   |
| 0      | Hit       |       | [0, 1, 3]   |
| 3      | Hit       |       | [0, 1, 3]   |
| 1      | Hit       |       | [0, 1, 3]   |
| 2      | Miss      | 3     | [0, 1, 2]   |
| 1      | Hit       |       | [0, 1, 2]   |

**Hit Rate**: (6 hits)/(5 misses + 6 hits) = 6/11 ≈ 54.5%
*Excluding compulsory misses*: (6 hits)/(3 compulsory misses excluded + 6 hits) = 6/9 ≈ 85.7%

### Why Optimal is Useful
- Serves as a comparison point for evaluating other policies.
- Helps determine how close to "perfect" your policy is.

## 4. Simple Replacement Policies

### FIFO (First-In, First-Out)
- Pages placed in queue when entering system; evict page at tail of queue on miss.
- **Strength**: Very simple to implement
- **Weakness**: Doesn't consider importance of pages - may kick out important ones that will be used soon.

#### Example: FIFO Tracing with Reference Stream 0,1,2,0,1,3,0,3,1,2,1 (cache size=3)

| Access | Hit/Miss? | Evict | Cache State |
|--------|-----------|-------|-------------|
| 0      | Miss      |       | [0]         |
| 1      | Miss      |       | [0, 1]      |
| 2      | Miss      |       | [0, 1, 2]   |
| 0      | Hit       |       | [0, 1, 2]   |
| 1      | Hit       |       | [0, 1, 2]   |
| 3      | Miss      | 0     | [1, 2, 3]   |
| 0      | Miss      | 1     | [2, 3, 0]   |
| 3      | Hit       |       | [2, 3, 0]   |
| 1      | Miss      | 2     | [3, 0, 1]   |
| 2      | Miss      | 3     | [0, 1, 2]   |
| 1      | Hit       |       | [0, 1, 2]   |

**Hit Rate**: (4 hits)/(7 misses + 4 hits) = 4/11 ≈ 36.4%
*Excluding compulsory misses*: (4 hits)/(5 non-compulsory misses + 4 hits) = 4/9 ≈ 44.4%

### Random Policy
- Evicts a random page when replacement needed.
- **Strength**: Simple to implement, no special data structures required.
- **Weakness**: Performance depends on luck.

#### Example: Random Tracing with Reference Stream (10k trials)
Figure 22.4 shows that:
- ~40% of the time, Random achieves optimal performance (6 hits)
- Sometimes performs poorly (as few as 2 hits)

### Belady's Anomaly
- A counterintuitive behavior where increasing cache size can *worsen* hit rate.
- **Example**: Reference stream: 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 with FIFO:
  - Cache size = 3 → Hit Rate ≈ 60%
  - Cache size = 4 → Hit Rate ≈ 50% (worse)
- **Why it happens**: FIFO doesn't have the "stack property" that LRU has.
- **Stack Property** [M+70]: For algorithms with this property, a cache of size N+1 naturally includes contents of cache of size N. Thus increasing cache size never worsens hit rate.

## 5. Historical Replacement Policies

### Key Concept: Principle of Locality
Programs tend to access certain code sequences and data structures frequently (temporal locality) or pages near each other (spatial locality).

**Types of Locality**:
- **Temporal Locality**: Pages accessed recently are likely to be accessed again soon.
- **Spatial Locality**: If page P is accessed, nearby pages (P-1, P+1) will also likely be accessed.

### LRU (Least Recently Used)
- Replaces the least-recently-used page when eviction needed.
- Uses history of access patterns to make better decisions than FIFO or Random.

#### Example: LRU Tracing with Reference Stream 0,1,2,0,1,3,0,3,1,2,1 (cache size=3)

| Access | Hit/Miss? | Evict | Cache State |
|--------|-----------|-------|-------------|
| 0      | Miss      |       | [0]         |
| 1      | Miss      |       | [0, 1]      |
| 2      | Miss      |       | [0, 1, 2]   |
| 0      | Hit       |       | [1, 2, 0]   |
| 1      | Hit       |       | [2, 0, 1]   |
| 3      | Miss      | 2     | [0, 1, 3]   |
| 0      | Hit       |       | [1, 3, 0]   |
| 3      | Hit       |       | [1, 0, 3]   |
| 1      | Hit       |       | [0, 3, 1]   |
| 2      | Miss      | 0     | [3, 1, 2]   |
| 1      | Hit       |       | [3, 2, 1]   |

**Hit Rate**: (6 hits)/(5 misses + 6 hits) = 6/11 ≈ 54.5% - same as optimal in this example.

### LFU (Least Frequently Used)
- Replaces the least-frequently-used page.
- Less common than LRU because frequency can be misleading; a page might have been accessed once long ago but not recently, while another was accessed many times recently.

## 6. Workload Examples

### No-Locality Workload
- Each reference is to random page within set of pages (no locality).
- **Key Finding**: When there's no locality, all policies perform similarly; hit rate depends only on cache size.
- Figure 22.6 shows LRU, FIFO, and Random converge as cache size increases.

### "80-20" Workload
- 80% of references to 20% of pages ("hot" pages); remaining 20% to other pages ("cold").
- **Key Finding**: 
  - LRU performs better than FIFO or Random because it keeps hot pages in cache.
  - Optimal still outperforms all others.

### "Looping Sequential Workload"
- Referencing a sequence of pages (e.g., 50 pages) repeatedly, with loop size larger than cache.
- **Key Finding**: 
  - LRU and FIFO perform poorly: even with cache size = N-1 for N-page workload, hit rate is 0% because they evict the page that will be accessed next in the sequence.
  - Random performs better (non-zero hit rate) due to lack of systematic behavior.

## 7. Implementing Historical Policies

### Challenge
Perfect LRU requires updating a data structure on every memory reference → high overhead for large systems.

**Example**: 
- Modern machine with 4GB RAM, 4KB pages = ~1 million pages.
- Scanning all time fields to find least-recently-used page would be prohibitively expensive.

### CRUX: How to implement LRU efficiently?

## 8. Approximating LRU

### Key Concept: Use Bit
- Hardware maintains a "use bit" per page (set when accessed).
- OS clears use bits periodically.
- Used in clock algorithm [C69].

#### Clock Algorithm:
1. Pages arranged in circular list with clock hand pointing to one page.
2. On replacement, check current page's use bit:
   - If 1: clear the bit and move clock forward
   - If 0: evict this page (least recently used)
3. Continue until finding a page with use bit = 0.

**Advantage**: Avoids scanning entire memory for least-recently-used page.

#### Clock Algorithm Variant:
- Figure 22.9 shows performance of clock algorithm on "80-20" workload.
- Performs better than FIFO or Random, though not as well as perfect LRU.

### Considering Dirty Pages
- **Modified bit** (dirty bit): Set when a page is written to disk.
- When evicting pages:
  - Prefer clean pages over dirty ones (avoid I/O cost of writing back)
  - Clock algorithm can be modified to scan for unused and clean first, then unused but dirty.

## 9. Other VM Policies

### Page Selection Policy
- **Demand paging**: Bring page into memory when accessed ("on demand").
- **Prefetching**: Anticipate future accesses (e.g., load code page P+1 after loading P).

### Write Back Strategy
- **Clustering/grouping writes**: Collect multiple pending write operations and perform a single efficient disk write.

## 10. Thrashing

### Key Concept: Thrashing
When memory demands exceed available physical memory → constant paging, leading to very poor performance.

#### Solutions:
- **Admission control**: Don't run all processes; choose subset whose working sets fit in memory.
- **Out-of-memory killer** (e.g., Linux): Kill a process when memory is oversubscribed.

## 11. Summary of Replacement Policies

| Policy | How it Works | Pros | Cons |
|--------|--------------|------|------|
| Optimal (Belady's MIN) | Evict page accessed furthest in future | Best possible performance | Not implementable for general OS |
| FIFO | First-in, first-out queue; evict oldest page | Simple to implement | Poor performance on many workloads; Belady's anomaly |
| Random | Evict random page | Very simple implementation | Performance depends on luck |
| LRU (Least Recently Used) | Evict least-recently-used page | Good for locality-based workloads | High overhead if implemented perfectly |
| Clock Algorithm | Approximates LRU using use bits and circular list | Efficient, low overhead | Slightly worse than perfect LRU |

## 12. Evolution of Replacement Policies

- **Historical context**: Importance decreased as memory became cheaper relative to disk speed.
- **Recent changes**: Faster storage (SSDs) has renewed interest in page replacement algorithms.

**Modern improvements over basic clock algorithm:**
- Scan resistance (e.g., ARC [MM03]) - avoids worst-case behavior like looping sequential workloads

## 13. Key Formulas and Concepts Summary

### Average Memory Access Time
```
AMAT = TM + (PMiss · TD)
```

Where:
- `TM` = memory access time
- `TD` = disk access time
- `PMiss` = miss rate probability

### Types of Cache Misses
| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Compulsory | First reference to a page (cold start) |
| Capacity | Page evicted because cache full, needed again later |
| Conflict | Only in hardware caches due to set-associativity; not applicable to OS page cache |

### Locality Types
| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Temporal | Recently accessed pages likely to be accessed again soon |
| Spatial | Accessing a page implies nearby pages will also be accessed |

# Beyond Physical Memory: Policies - Comprehensive Study Notes

---

## **Introduction to Virtual Memory Replacement Policy**

### The Core Problem
When physical memory is scarce, the operating system must decide which page(s) to evict from RAM when new pages need to be loaded. This decision-making process is encapsulated within the **replacement policy** of the virtual memory manager.

> **THE CRUX**: *How do we decide which page (or pages) to evict?*

This problem becomes critical as physical memory pressure increases, forcing the OS to start paging out pages to make room for actively-used ones. Historically, this was one of the most important decisions early virtual memory systems made due to limited physical memory.

---

## **Cache Management Fundamentals**

### Virtual Memory as a Cache
Main memory holds some subset of all pages in the system → can be viewed as a cache for virtual memory pages.

**Goal**: Minimize number of *cache misses* (page faults) or maximize *cache hits* (pages found in memory).

#### Average Memory Access Time (AMAT)
The key metric used to evaluate replacement policies:

```
AMAT = TM + (PMiss · TD)
```

Where:
- `TM` = cost of accessing main memory
- `TD` = cost of accessing disk
- `PMiss` = probability of a miss (0.0 ≤ PMiss ≤ 1.0)

**Example Calculation:**
- Memory access time (`TM`) = 100 nanoseconds
- Disk access time (`TD`) = 10 milliseconds = 10,000,000 ns
- Miss rate (`PMiss`) = 0.1 (10% miss rate)

AMAT = 100 + (0.1 × 10,000,000) = **1,000,100 nanoseconds ≈ 1 millisecond**

**Key Insight**: Disk access is so expensive that even a small miss rate dominates AMAT:
- With hit rate of 99.9% (PMiss=0.001):  
  AMAT = 100 + (0.001 × 10,000,000) = **10,100 nanoseconds ≈ 10 microseconds**

> As the hit rate approaches 100%, AMAT approaches `TM` (memory access time).

---

## **The Optimal Replacement Policy**

### Belady's MIN Algorithm
- Proposed by Laszlo A. Belady in [B66]
- Replaces the page that will be accessed *furthest in the future* → minimizes total misses

**Why it works**: If you must evict a page, choose one needed farthest in the future to ensure pages more likely to be used soon remain in memory.

#### Optimal Policy Tracing Example
Reference stream: `0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 3, 0, 3, 1, 2, 1` (cache size = 3)

| Access | Hit/Miss? | Evict | Cache State |
|--------|-----------|-------|-------------|
| 0      | Miss      |       | [0]         |
| 1      | Miss      |       | [0, 1]      |
| 2      | Miss      |       | [0, 1, 2]   |
| 0      | Hit       |       | [0, 1, 2]   |
| 1      | Hit       |       | [0, 1, 2]   |
| 3      | Miss      | 2     | [0, 1, 3]   |
| 0      | Hit       |       | [0, 1, 3]   |
| 3      | Hit       |       | [0, 1, 3]   |
| 1      | Hit       |       | [0, 1, 3]   |
| 2      | Miss      | 3     | [0, 1, 2]   |
| 1      | Hit       |       | [0, 1, 2]   |

**Hit Rate**: (6 hits)/(5 misses + 6 hits) = **54.5%**
*Excluding compulsory misses*: (6 hits)/(3 compulsory misses excluded + 6 hits) = **85.7%**

> **Why Optimal is Useful**: It serves as a comparison point for evaluating other policies, showing how close to "perfect" your policy is.

---

## **Simple Replacement Policies: FIFO and Random**

### FIFO (First-In-First-Out)
- Pages placed in queue when entering system; evict page at tail of queue on miss
- **Strength**: Very simple to implement
- **Weakness**: Doesn't consider importance of pages → may kick out important ones

#### FIFO Tracing Example
Reference stream: `0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 3, 0, 3, 1, 2, 1` (cache size = 3)

| Access | Hit/Miss? | Evict | Cache State |
|--------|-----------|-------|-------------|
| 0      | Miss      |       | [0]         |
| 1      | Miss      |       | [0, 1]      |
| 2      | Miss      |       | [0, 1, 2]   |
| 0      | Hit       |       | [0, 1, 2]   |
| 1      | Hit       |       | [0, 1, 2]   |
| 3      | Miss      | 0     | [1, 2, 3]   |
| 0      | Miss      | 1     | [2, 3, 0]   |
| 3      | Hit       |       | [2, 3, 0]   |
| 1      | Miss      | 2     | [3, 0, 1]   |
| 2      | Miss      | 3     | [0, 1, 2]   |
| 1      | Hit       |       | [0, 1, 2]   |

**Hit Rate**: (4 hits)/(7 misses + 4 hits) = **~36.4%**

### Random Policy
- Evicts a random page when replacement needed
- Performance depends on luck

#### Random Performance Analysis
Figure 22.4 shows performance over 10,000 trials:
- ~40% of time: Achieves optimal (6 hits)
- Sometimes performs poorly (<3 hits)

> **Key Insight**: Simple policies like FIFO and Random don't consider page importance → often perform worse than LRU.

---

## **Belady's Anomaly**

### What is it?
A counterintuitive behavior where *increasing* cache size can *worsen* hit rate for certain reference streams with specific replacement algorithms (FIFO).

#### Example Reference Stream
`1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5`

| Cache Size | Hit Rate |
|------------|----------|
| 3          | ~60%     |
| **4**      | **~50%** |

> This is called *Belady's Anomaly* (to the chagrin of Belady and colleagues).

### Why it Happens
- FIFO doesn't have a "stack property" [M+70]
- Algorithms with stack property: A cache of size N+1 naturally includes contents of cache of size N → increasing cache never worsens hit rate.

> **Stack Property**: For algorithms like LRU, when you increase the cache size from N to N+1, all pages in a size-N cache remain in the larger cache. This prevents Belady's Anomaly.

---

## **Historical Replacement Policies: LRU**

### Principle of Locality
Programs tend to access certain code sequences and data structures frequently:
- **Temporal locality**: Pages accessed recently are likely to be accessed again soon.
- **Spatial locality**: Accessing a page implies nearby pages will also be accessed (e.g., array elements).

> *Note: Not all programs exhibit strong locality; some have random memory access patterns.*

### LRU (Least Recently Used)
- Replaces the least-recently-used page when eviction needed
- Uses history of accesses to make better decisions than FIFO or Random

#### LRU Tracing Example
Reference stream: `0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 3, 0, 3, 1, 2, 1` (cache size = 3)

| Access | Hit/Miss? | Evict | Cache State |
|--------|-----------|-------|-------------|
| 0      | Miss      |       | [0]         |
| 1      | Miss      |       | [0, 1]      |
| 2      | Miss      |       | [0, 1, 2]   |
| 0      | Hit       |       | [1, 2, 0]   |
| 1      | Hit       |       | [2, 0, 1]   |
| 3      | Miss      | 2     | [0, 1, 3]   |
| 0      | Hit       |       | [1, 3, 0]   |
| 3      | Hit       |       | [1, 0, 3]   |
| 1      | Hit       |       | [0, 3, 1]   |
| 2      | Miss      | 0     | [3, 1, 2]   |
| 1      | Hit       |       | [3, 2, 1]   |

**Hit Rate**: (6 hits)/(5 misses + 6 hits) = **~54.5%** - matches optimal in this example.

> LRU performs as well as the optimal policy for many common workloads due to locality principles.

---

## **Workload Examples**

### No-Locality Workload
- Each reference is random page within set of accessed pages (no locality)
- 10,000 total accesses across 100 unique pages

**Key Findings from Figure 22.6:**
| Policy | Performance |
|--------|-------------|
| Optimal | Best performance |
| LRU/FIFO/Random | All perform similarly; hit rate depends only on cache size |

> **Conclusion**: When there's no locality, all realistic policies behave the same.

### "80-20" Workload
- 80% of references to 20% of pages ("hot" pages)
- Remaining 20% to other pages ("cold")

**Key Findings from Figure 22.7:**
| Policy | Performance |
|--------|-------------|
| Optimal | Best performance |
| LRU | Better than FIFO/Random (keeps hot pages) |
| FIFO/Random | Reasonable but worse |

> **Why**: Hot pages have been accessed frequently in the past → likely to be accessed again soon.

### "Looping Sequential" Workload
- Referencing 50 pages sequentially, then looping back to start (e.g., `0,1,...49,0,1...`)
- Total of 10,000 accesses

**Key Findings from Figure 22.8:**
| Policy | Hit Rate with Cache Size = 49 |
|--------|-------------------------------|
| Optimal | ~5% (not perfect) |
| LRU/FIFO | **0%** (worst-case behavior) |
| Random | >0% |

> **Why**: Both LRU and FIFO evict pages that will be accessed again soon in the loop.

## **Implementing Historical Policies**

### Challenge: Perfect LRU Overhead
- Requires updating data structure on *every* memory reference → high overhead for large systems.
  
**Example Calculation**: 
- 4GB RAM with 4KB pages = ~1 million pages
- Scanning all time fields to find least-recently-used page would be prohibitively expensive.

> **CRUX**: How can we approximate LRU efficiently without scanning the entire memory?

---

## **Approximating LRU: The Clock Algorithm**

### Key Concept: Use Bit (Reference Bit)
- Hardware maintains a "use bit" per page (set when accessed).
- OS clears use bits periodically.
- Used to approximate LRU.

#### How Clock Algorithm Works:
1. Arrange pages in circular list with clock hand pointing at one page
2. On replacement, check current page's use bit:
   - If 1: clear the bit and move clock forward
   - If 0: evict this page (least recently used)
3. Continue until finding a page with use bit = 0

**Advantage**: Avoids scanning entire memory for least-recently-used page.

#### Clock Algorithm Performance
Figure 22.9 shows performance on "80-20" workload:
| Policy | Hit Rate |
|--------|----------|
| Optimal | ~75%     |
| LRU (perfect) | ~65%   |
| **Clock** | **~60%** |

> Clock algorithm performs better than FIFO/Random but slightly worse than perfect LRU.

## **Considering Dirty Pages**

### Modified Bit (Dirty Bit)
- Set when a page is written to disk
- Used in replacement decisions

#### Why Consider It:
- If a page has been modified ("dirty"), it must be written back to disk before eviction → expensive I/O.
- Clean pages can be evicted without additional I/O.

**Clock Algorithm Enhancement**: 
1. Scan for unused and clean pages first (evict these)
2. Failing that, scan for unused but dirty pages
3. Then consider other options

> **Key Insight**: Evicting clean pages avoids unnecessary disk writes → improves performance.

---

## **Other VM Policies**

### Page Selection Policy
- **Demand paging**: Bring page into memory when accessed ("on demand")
- **Prefetching**: Anticipate future accesses (e.g., load code page P+1 after loading P)

> *Example*: Some systems assume that if a code page is loaded, the next one will be needed soon.

### Write Back Strategy
- **Clustering/grouping writes**: Collect multiple pending write operations and perform single efficient disk write.
  
**Why it works**: Disk drives perform better with fewer large writes than many small ones.

---

## **Thrashing**

### What is Thrashing?
When memory demands exceed available physical memory → constant paging, leading to very poor performance (system spends more time swapping pages than executing instructions).

#### Solutions:
| Approach | Mechanism |
|----------|-----------|
| Admission Control | Don't run all processes; choose subset whose working sets fit in memory. |
| Out-of-Memory Killer (e.g., Linux) | Kill a process when memory is oversubscribed to reduce pressure. |

> **Trade-off**: Admission control preserves user experience but may limit throughput; out-of-memory killer reduces memory pressure quickly but can kill critical processes.

## **Summary of Replacement Policies**

| Policy | How it Works | Pros | Cons |
|--------|--------------|------|------|
| Optimal (Belady's MIN) | Evict page accessed furthest in future | Best possible performance | Not implementable for general OS |
| FIFO | First-in, first-out queue; evict oldest page | Simple to implement | Poor on many workloads; Belady's anomaly |
| Random | Evict random page | Very simple implementation | Performance depends on luck |
| LRU (Least Recently Used) | Evict least-recently-used page | Good for locality-based workloads | High overhead if implemented perfectly |
| Clock Algorithm | Approximates LRU using use bits and circular list | Efficient, low overhead; avoids worst-case behavior | Slightly worse than perfect LRU |

---

## **Evolution of Replacement Policies**

- **Historical context**: Importance decreased as memory became cheaper relative to disk speed.
  - *Reason*: Paging was so expensive that even good replacement algorithms couldn't help if frequent paging occurred.

- **Recent changes**: Faster storage (SSDs) has renewed interest in page replacement:
  - Flash-based SSDs have changed performance ratios
  - Modern systems like ARC [MM03] improve upon basic clock algorithm

> *Modern improvement*: Scan-resistant algorithms avoid worst-case behavior of LRU on looping sequential workloads.

## **Key Formulas and Concepts**

### Average Memory Access Time (AMAT)
```
AMAT = TM + (PMiss · TD)
```

Where:
- `TM` = memory access time
- `TD` = disk access time
- `PMiss` = miss rate probability

### Types of Cache Misses
| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Compulsory** | First reference to a page (cold start) |
| **Capacity** | Page evicted because cache full, needed again later |
| **Conflict** | Only in hardware caches due to set-associativity; not applicable to OS page cache |

### Locality Types
| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Temporal** | Recently accessed pages likely to be accessed again soon (e.g., loop iterations) |
| **Spatial** | Accessing a page implies nearby pages will also be accessed (e.g., array elements in sequence) |
