# Week 4: Lecture 4 - Memory Swapping

## Overview
This lecture builds upon last week's discussion of memory virtualization (segmentation and paging) to explore how operating systems manage memory through **translation lookaside buffers**, **page tables**, and **memory swapping**. We'll examine the critical role of locality in optimizing memory access, analyze TLB performance metrics, compare page replacement algorithms, and understand the implications of thrashing on system performance.

## Memory Paging Fundamentals

### Revisiting Paging
Paging simplifies memory management by dividing both physical and virtual memory into fixed-size blocks called **pages** (typically 4KB). This eliminates external fragmentation—where free memory is scattered in small chunks—and makes swapping pages between RAM and disk more efficient. 

The page lookup process involves:
1. Getting the Virtual Page Number (VPN) from a register
2. Calculating the address of the Page Table Entry (PTE)
3. Reading the PTE from memory
4. Extracting the Physical Frame Number (PFN)
5. Building the physical address
6. Accessing the actual data in RAM

*Instructor Insight*: "This process is slow because it requires multiple memory accesses—especially with multi-level page tables where you traverse a tree structure to find your page."

### Locality: The Key to Efficient Memory Access
Programs exhibit two types of locality that we can exploit:

- **Spatial Locality**: Programs tend to access memory locations near each other (e.g., array elements).
  > *Example*: When summing an array, consecutive elements are likely on the same page.

- **Temporal Locality**: Programs tend to reuse the same data or instructions repeatedly.
  > *Example*: In a loop that sums an array, the `sum` variable and array elements will be accessed multiple times.

*Instructor Emphasis*: "If you're writing code that accesses memory in a way that exploits locality, your program will run much faster. This is why cache-friendly algorithms matter."

## Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB)

### What is a TLB?
The **Translation Lookaside Buffer** is a small, fast hardware cache that stores recently used virtual-to-physical address translations. It's designed to avoid the slow page table lookups required for every memory access.

*Instructor Insight*: "Think of it as a specialized cache specifically for translation information—like having a shortcut map instead of constantly checking a big directory."

### How TLBs Work
The TLB stores entries containing:
- **Virtual Page Number (VPN)**
- **Physical Frame Number (PFN)**
- **Additional tags** (valid bit, protection bits, ASID)

When the CPU needs to translate an address:
1. It checks if the VPN exists in the TLB.
2. If it's present (**TLB hit**), it uses the PFN directly.
3. If not (**TLB miss**), it must look up the page table.

*Instructor Insight*: "A TLB miss is like asking for a book in a library and having to check the catalog first—much slower than just knowing where it's on the shelf."

### Content Addressable Memory (CAM)
Unlike regular memory that uses addresses, CAM searches by content. The TLB uses this principle:
> *Imagine* checking all entries simultaneously: "Is this address in my cache?" instead of sequentially searching.

This parallel search makes TLB lookups extremely fast—often completing in a single CPU cycle.

## TLB Performance Analysis

### Measuring TLB Effectiveness
The key metric is **miss rate**:
```
TLB miss rate = (Number of TLB misses) / (Total number of memory accesses)
```

*Instructor Insight*: "A good TLB should have a very low miss rate—ideally under 1% for most workloads."

### Example Calculation
Consider summing an array with `N=2000` elements:
- Page size = 4KB (4096 bytes)
- Integer size = 4 bytes → ~1024 integers per page
- For N=2000, we need 2 pages

```
Miss rate = 2 misses / 2000 accesses ≈ 0.1%
```

*Instructor Insight*: "This is why locality matters—without it, you'd have a miss for every single access."

### Strategies to Improve TLB Performance
| Strategy | How It Works | Trade-offs |
|----------|--------------|------------|
| **Larger page sizes** | Fewer pages needed → fewer misses | Increased internal fragmentation (wasted memory) |
| **Larger TLBs** | More entries available for caching | Hardware complexity and cost increase |
| **Exploiting locality** | Keep frequently accessed pages in cache | Requires understanding program behavior |

*Instructor Insight*: "The best strategy is to exploit both spatial and temporal locality—keep the same page in memory while you're using it repeatedly."

---

## Handling Multiple Processes

### The Context Switch Problem
When switching between processes, TLB entries become invalid because:
- Different processes use different virtual address spaces.
- A process's pages may not exist for another process.

*Instructor Insight*: "It's like having a library card that only works at one specific branch—when you switch libraries, your card is useless."

### Solutions to Context Switch Issues

| Solution | How It Works | Pros | Cons |
|----------|--------------|------|------|
| **Flush the TLB** | Clear all entries on context switch | Simple implementation | Causes cold start misses for new process |
| **ASID (Address Space ID)** | Tag each entry with process ID | No extra comparison needed | Requires hardware support; adds complexity |
| **Multiple TLBs** | Dedicated TLB per process or memory type | Obvious solution | Hardware constraints limit size; expensive |

*Instructor Insight*: "The ASID approach is the most common in modern systems—it's like having a library card with your name on it so you can keep track of which books belong to whom."

### Sharing Memory Between Processes
- **Read-only sharing**: Safe for multiple processes (no concurrency issues)
- **Full sharing**: Requires careful synchronization (concurrency problems)
- **Copy-on-write**: Default behavior—share pages until a write occurs, then copy

*Instructor Insight*: "This is how modern systems efficiently share libraries between programs without duplicating code."

## TLB Implementation Approaches

### Hardware vs. Software Managed
| Approach | How It Works | Performance | Flexibility |
|----------|--------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Hardware-managed** (x86, ARMv8) | Automatic on miss: load page table entry into TLB | Faster | Rigid structure; limited to hardware design |
| **Software-managed** (MIPS, SPARC) | OS handles misses via traps and updates TLB | Slower | More flexible; can implement custom algorithms |

*Instructor Insight*: "Hardware management is faster but less adaptable—like having a fixed menu at a restaurant versus being able to order anything you want."

---

## Page Faults and Demand Paging

### What is a Page Fault?
A page fault occurs when:
- The TLB misses AND the PTE shows the page isn't in physical memory (`Present = 0`)
- There's a protection violation (e.g., writing to read-only memory)

*Instructor Insight*: "Page faults are like hitting '404' on the internet—they mean you're trying to access something that doesn't exist."

### Page Fault Handling Process
1. Save state of faulting instruction
2. Run page-fault handler in OS kernel mode
3. Find missing page (from disk or memory)
4. Read page into physical frame
5. Update PTE to mark as valid (`Present = 1`)
6. Resume original instruction

*Instructor Insight*: "This is why programs start slowly—they have to load pages on demand, not all at once."

### Demand Paging Benefits
- **Faster startup**: Only load necessary code/data initially
- **Memory efficiency**: Avoid loading unused memory regions
- **Better performance for large applications**

## Page Replacement Algorithms

### The Core Problem
When the TLB is full and a new page needs to be loaded, which existing entry should we evict?

*Instructor Insight*: "This is like deciding what books to keep on your bookshelf when you get more books than can fit."

### Algorithm Comparison

| Algorithm | How It Works | Performance | Implementation Difficulty |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|--------------------------|
| **Optimal** | Evicts the page not needed for longest time in future | Best possible (0% misses) | Impossible to implement (requires knowing future) |
| **Least Recently Used (LRU)** | Evicts least recently accessed page | Very good; close to optimal | Moderate difficulty (approximated with access bits) |
| **First-In-First-Out (FIFO)** | Evicts oldest entry in TLB | Can be poor; may cause thrashing | Simple implementation |
| **Random** | Randomly evicts a page | Reasonable performance | Very simple |

*Instructor Insight*: "Optimal is the gold standard for comparison, but it's like trying to predict the future—it's impossible to implement."

### Optimal Algorithm Example
Given sequence: `1, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 2, 4, 3, 1, 3, 4, 2, 1` (with only 4 TLB slots)

| Step | Requested Page | TLB State | Miss? |
|------|----------------|-----------|-------|
| 1    | 1              | [1]       | Yes   |
| 2    | 5              | [1, 5]    | Yes   |
| 3    | 4              | [1, 5, 4] | Yes   |
| 4    | 3              | [1, 5, 4, 3] | Yes |
| 5    | 2              | [5, 4, 3, 2] | No (replaced 1) |
| ...  | ...            | ...       | ...   |

*Result*: Only **6 misses** out of **15 accesses** → **40% miss rate**

### FIFO Algorithm Example
Same sequence: `1, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 2, 4, 3, 1, 3, 4, 2, 1`

| Step | Requested Page | TLB State | Miss? |
|------|----------------|-----------|-------|
| 1    | 1              | [1]       | Yes   |
| 2    | 5              | [1, 5]    | Yes   |
| 3    | 4              | [1, 5, 4] | Yes   |
| 4    | 3              | [1, 5, 4, 3] | Yes |
| 5    | 2              | [5, 4, 3, 2] | No (replaced 1) |
| ...  | ...            | ...       | ...   |

*Result*: **6 misses** out of **15 accesses** → **40% miss rate**

*Instructor Insight*: "FIFO seems similar to LRU here, but it can be terrible in practice—like a queue where you keep kicking out the person who'll need help next."

### Belady's Anomaly
A counterintuitive phenomenon where:
- Increasing TLB size **increases** miss rate for FIFO

*Example*: For sequence `3, 2, 1, 5, 3, 2, 4, 1, 2` with FIFO:
- With 3 slots: 9 misses
- With 4 slots: 10 misses

*Instructor Insight*: "This is why you can't always trust intuition—more memory doesn't always mean better performance."

## Advanced Memory Management Concepts

### Memory Layout and Bit Usage
| Component | Purpose | Example |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| **Present bit** | Indicates if page is in physical RAM | `0` = not loaded, `1` = loaded |
| **Valid bit** | Indicates if entry is meaningful | `0` = invalid address (e.g., null pointer) |
| **Dirty bit** | Indicates if page has been modified | `0` = clean (can discard without writing), `1` = dirty (must write to disk before discarding) |

*Instructor Insight*: "The dirty bit is like a 'changed' indicator on your document—you only need to save it when you've made changes."

### Thrashing
**Thrashing** occurs when:
- System spends more time handling page faults than executing useful work.
- High CPU usage with low user process progress.

*Symptoms*:
- Low **user CPU utilization**
- High **system CPU utilization**
- Constant page swapping between RAM and disk

*Instructor Insight*: "It's like having a busy restaurant where the staff is constantly running to get new ingredients instead of serving customers."

### Guard Pages
Special pages (usually at address 0) that:
- Prevent null pointer dereferences from accessing valid memory.
- Trigger exceptions when accessed.

*Instructor Insight*: "This is how you prevent 'null pointer exception' errors—by making the null page inaccessible."

## Summary and Key Takeaways

### Core Concepts
1. **Paging** eliminates external fragmentation by dividing memory into fixed-size pages (typically 4KB).
2. **Locality** (spatial & temporal) enables efficient memory access patterns.
3. **TLB** is a specialized cache for virtual-to-physical address translations.
4. **Page faults** occur when requested data isn't in physical RAM, requiring disk I/O.

### Performance Metrics
| Metric | Formula | Ideal Value |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| TLB Miss Rate | (Misses / Total Accesses) | < 1% for most workloads |
| Page Fault Rate | (Faults / Total Memory Requests) | As low as possible |

### Algorithm Comparison
| Algorithm | Best For | Worst Case | Implementation Complexity |
|-----------|----------|------------|---------------------------|
| **Optimal** | Benchmarking | Impossible to implement | N/A |
| **LRU** | General use | Good performance | Moderate (approximated with access bits) |
| **FIFO** | Simple systems | Can cause thrashing | Very simple |
| **Random** | Quick implementation | Reasonable performance | Extremely simple |

### Practical Applications
- **Copy-on-write**: Used in `fork()` system calls to efficiently create new processes.
- **Demand paging**: Enables large applications without loading all code at startup.
- **Guard pages**: Prevents null pointer dereferences from causing security issues.
