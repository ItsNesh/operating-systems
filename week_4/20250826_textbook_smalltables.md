## Introduction to Page Table Size Problem

### The Core Issue
**CRUX**: *How to make page tables smaller?* 

Linear page tables consume excessive memory, especially with large address spaces. Let's analyze the problem:

- **32-bit address space**: $2^{32}$ bytes = 4GB of virtual memory
- **Page size**: Typically 4KB ($2^{12}$ bytes)
- **Number of pages**: $\frac{2^{32}}{2^{12}} = 2^{20} \approx$ 1 million pages
- **PTE (Page Table Entry) size**: Usually 4 bytes

**Memory consumption for a single page table**:
$$\text{Size} = (\text{Number of Pages}) \times (\text{PTE Size}) = 2^{20} \times 4\, \text{bytes} = 4,\!194,\!304\, \text{bytes} \approx 4\, \text{MB}$$

**System impact**: With a hundred active processes (common on modern systems), we'd need **hundreds of megabytes just for page tables**, which is inefficient.

> 💡 *Key Insight*: Page tables are data structures that can be optimized. The problem isn't the concept of paging itself, but how to implement it efficiently in memory-constrained environments.

---

## 20.1 Simple Solution: Bigger Pages

### Concept
Reduce page table size by increasing page size (e.g., from 4KB to 16KB).

**Example calculation for 32-bit address space with 16KB pages**:
- Page offset bits: $\log_2(16\, \text{KB}) = 14$ bits
- VPN (Virtual Page Number) size: $32 - 14 = 18$ bits
- Number of entries in page table: $2^{18}$
- Total page table size: $2^{18} \times 4\, \text{bytes} = 1,\!048,\!576\, \text{bytes} \approx 1\, \text{MB}$

**Reduction**: Page tables are **four times smaller** (from 4MB to 1MB).

### Limitations: Internal Fragmentation
- Larger pages lead to wasted memory within each page.
- Applications allocate entire large pages but only use small portions of them.
- Memory fills with unused space in these overly-large allocations.

> 📌 *Key Term*: **Internal fragmentation** - Waste internal to the allocated unit (page), caused by fixed-size allocation units being larger than needed for a specific request.

### Multiple Page Sizes
Modern architectures support multiple page sizes:
| Architecture | Common Small Pages | Large Pages |
|--------------|-------------------|-------------|
| x86          | 4KB               | 2MB, 1GB    |
| SPARCv9      | 8KB               | 512KB       |
| MIPS         | 4KB               | 1MB         |

**Purpose of large pages**: 
- Reduce TLB pressure (fewer entries needed for same address space)
- Common in database management systems and high-performance applications

> ⚠️ *Important Note*: Multiple page sizes are **not primarily used to save page table space**, but rather to reduce TLB misses. As [N+02] shows, this increases OS complexity significantly.

---

## 20.2 Hybrid Approach: Paging and Segments

### Conceptual Foundation
Combine paging (for fine-grained memory management) with segmentation (to group related address spaces).

**Why hybrid?**: 
- Linear page tables waste space on unused regions.
- Segmentation naturally groups logically related parts of an address space.

> 💡 *Key Insight*: **Hybrid approaches** often combine two seemingly opposing ideas to achieve the best of both worlds. As stated in Slide 5: *"When you have two good and seemingly opposing ideas, you should always see if you can combine them into a hybrid that manages to achieve the best of both worlds."*

### Multics System (Historical Context)
- Jack Dennis combined paging with segmentation.
- Each logical segment had its own page table.

**Example**: 16KB address space with 1KB pages
- **Virtual Address Space Layout**:
  - Code: Pages 0-3 ($\text{VPN} = 0$ to $3$)
  - Heap: Page 4 ($\text{VPN} = 4$)
  - Stack: Pages 14-15 ($\text{VPN} = 14, 15$)

**Page Table for Linear Approach (Figure 20.2)**:
| PFN | Valid | Prot | Present | Dirty |
|-----|-------|------|---------|-------|
| 10  | 1     | r-x  | 1       | 0     |
| -   | 0     | —    | -       | -     |
| ... | ...   | ...  | ...     | ...   |
| 23  | 1     | rw-  | 1       | 1     |
| ... | ...   | ...  | ...     | ...   |
| 28  | 1     | rw-  | 1       | 1     |
| 4   | 1     | rw-  | 1       | 1     |

**Problem**: Most entries are invalid (wasted space).

### Hybrid Implementation
- **Three page tables**: One for code, one for heap, one for stack.
- **MMU Modifications**:
  - Base register points to the physical address of a segment's page table.
  - Bounds register indicates maximum valid pages in that segment.

**Address Format Example (32-bit system)**:
```
31    30   ...     24      23        0
| Seg | VPN | Offset |
```

- **Segment bits**: Top 2 bits of address space.
  - `00`: Unused
  - `01`: Code segment
  - `10`: Heap segment
  - `11`: Stack segment

**Translation Process (Hardware)**:
```python
SN = (VirtualAddress & SEG_MASK) >> SN_SHIFT    # Segment number
VPN = (VirtualAddress & VPN_MASK) >> VPN_SHIFT   # Virtual Page Number
AddressOfPTE = Base[SN] + (VPN * sizeof(PTE))
```

### Advantages and Limitations

| Advantage | Limitation |
|-----------|------------|
| Reduces page table size by only allocating space for used segments. | Requires segmentation, which assumes specific usage patterns.<br>(e.g., large but sparsely-used heap still wastes space) |
| Eliminates wasted entries between unused regions (stack and heap). | Causes **external fragmentation** in memory allocation for page tables. |

> 📌 *Key Term*: **External fragmentation** - Wasted space due to non-contiguous free blocks, making it difficult to allocate large contiguous chunks.

---

## 20.3 Multi-level Page Tables

### Core Concept
Transform linear page table into a tree-like structure (hierarchical) where:
- Only pages of the page table that contain valid mappings are allocated.
- A **page directory** tracks which parts of the page table exist in memory.

> 💡 *Key Insight*: "It just makes parts of the linear page table disappear, freeing those frames for other uses."

### Example: 2-Level Page Table
![Multi-level vs Linear Page Tables](https://i.imgur.com/8KZQv5l.png)

**Linear Page Table (Left)**:
- Requires full allocation even if most entries are invalid.

**Multi-level Page Table (Right)**:
- Only allocates pages of the page table that contain valid mappings.
- Uses a **page directory** to track which parts exist in memory.

### Structure Details
| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Page Directory Entry (PDE)** | Contains: <br> - Valid bit<br> - Page Frame Number (PFN) of the page table segment it points to |
| **Valid Bit Meaning**:<br>If valid, at least one PTE on that page is valid. |

### Time-Space Trade-off
- ✅ *Space Advantage*: Only allocates memory proportional to actual usage.
- ❌ *Time Cost*: On TLB miss, requires two additional memory accesses (page directory + PTE).

> 💡 *Key Insight*: "Multi-level tables are a small example of a time-space trade-off. We wanted smaller tables (and got them), but not for free."

### Detailed Multi-Level Example

**Address Space**: 16KB with 64-byte pages
- Virtual address: **14 bits**
  - VPN: **8 bits**, Offset: **6 bits**
- Linear page table size: $2^8 \times 4\, \text{bytes} = 1,\!024\, \text{bytes}$ (1KB)
- Page directory needs to track each of the 16 pages ($\frac{1024}{64}=16$)

**Indexing Process**:
```
VPN: [13 12 11 10 | 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2]
       Page Directory Index    Page Table Index
```

- **Page directory index**: Top 4 bits of VPN (bits 13-10)
- **Page table index**: Remaining 4 bits of VPN (bits 9-6)

**Translation Example: Virtual Address `0x3F80`**
- Binary: `11 1111 1000 0000`
- Offset = `000000` → Byte offset within page
- **VPN**: `11 1111 10` (bits 13-6)
  - Page directory index: `1111` → Selects last entry in page directory
  - Points to physical frame number = `101`
  - Page table index: `1110` → 14th entry on the page

**Result**: Physical address = `(PFN=55 << SHIFT) + offset = 0x37 << 6 + 0 = 0xDC0`

### More Than Two Levels
When a single level of directory becomes too large:

- **Example**: 30-bit virtual address, 512-byte pages (PTE size: 4 bytes)
  - PTEs per page: $512 / 4 = 128$
  - Bits needed for index into page table: $\log_2(128) = 7$ bits
  - Remaining bits in VPN: $30-9=21$, so **14 bits** left for directory

> 💡 *Key Insight*: "If our page directory has $2^{14}$ entries (and 4-byte PDEs), it spans not one page but 128, and our goal of making every piece fit within a page vanishes."

### Solution: Add More Levels
```
VPN: [29-23 | 22-16 | 15-9]
       PD0      PD1     Page Table Index
```

**Translation Process (Algorithm)**:
```python
// Figure 20.6 Control Flow for Multi-level Page Tables

1  VPN = (VirtualAddress & VPN_MASK) >> SHIFT
2  (Success, TlbEntry) = TLB_Lookup(VPN)
3  if (Success == True) // TLB Hit
4      if (CanAccess(TlbEntry.ProtectBits) == True)
5          Offset = VirtualAddress & OFFSET_MASK
6          PhysAddr = (TlbEntry.PFN << SHIFT) | Offset
7          Register = AccessMemory(PhysAddr)
8      else RaiseException(PROTECTION_FAULT)
9  else // TLB Miss
10     PDIndex = (VPN & PD_MASK) >> PD_SHIFT    # Top bits for first level
11     PDEAddr = PDBR + (PDIndex * sizeof(PDE))
12     PDE = AccessMemory(PDEAddr)
13     if (PDE.Valid == False)
14         RaiseException(SEGMENTATION_FAULT)
15     else
16         PTIndex = (VPN & PT_MASK) >> PT_SHIFT  # Next bits for second level
17         PTEAddr = (PDE.PFN << SHIFT) + (PTIndex * sizeof(PTE))
18         PTE = AccessMemory(PTEAddr)
19         if (PTE.Valid == False)
20             RaiseException(SEGMENTATION_FAULT)
21         else if (CanAccess(PTE.ProtectBits) == False)
22             RaiseException(PROTECTION_FAULT)
23         else
24             TLB_Insert(VPN, PTE.PFN, PTE.ProtectBits)
25             RetryInstruction()
```

## 20.4 Inverted Page Tables

### Conceptual Shift
Instead of having **one page table per process**, use a **single global page table** that maps physical pages to virtual addresses.

- Each entry contains:
  - Which process is using this physical page.
  - Which virtual page in that process corresponds to it.

> 💡 *Key Insight*: "Inverted page tables illustrate what we've said from the beginning: page tables are just data structures. You can do lots of crazy things with data structures."

### Implementation
- **Hash table** is often used for fast lookup (linear scan would be too slow).
- Example architecture using inverted page tables: PowerPC.

| Traditional Page Table | Inverted Page Table |
|------------------------|---------------------|
| One per process        | Single global structure |
| Maps virtual pages to physical frames  | Maps physical frames to virtual addresses |
| Size proportional to address space size | Size proportional to number of physical pages |

> ⚠️ *Trade-off*: While inverted tables save memory, they require more complex lookup mechanisms.

---

## 20.5 Swapping the Page Tables to Disk

### Relaxing an Assumption
Previously assumed page tables reside in kernel-owned physical memory.

**New Approach**: 
- Place large page tables into **kernel virtual memory**.
- Allow system to swap some of these page tables to disk when memory pressure is high.

> 💡 *Key Insight*: "This allows the system to move pages between main memory and secondary storage (disk), which we'll discuss in more detail later."

---

## 20.6 Summary

### Key Concepts
| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Linear Page Tables** | Simple array-based structure; too large for typical systems. |
| **Bigger Pages** | Reduces table size but causes internal fragmentation (wasted space within pages). |
| **Hybrid Approach** | Combines paging with segmentation to reduce wasted entries between segments. |
| **Multi-level Page Tables** | Hierarchical structure that allocates only used portions of the page table; uses a directory for tracking. |
| **Inverted Page Tables** | Single global table mapping physical pages to virtual addresses (process + VPN). |

### Trade-offs
- **Space vs Time**: Smaller tables save memory but increase TLB miss cost.
  - Linear: Fast lookup, large space consumption.
  - Multi-level: Slower lookup on misses, smaller space usage.

> 💡 *Key Insight*: "The right choice of structure depends strongly on the constraints of the given environment."

### Memory-Constrained Systems
- Prefer **smaller structures** (multi-level page tables).
- Prioritize memory efficiency over speed for TLB hits.

### Modern System Considerations
- With abundant memory, larger table sizes may be acceptable.
- For systems with large address spaces and heavy usage patterns:
  - Larger tables can reduce the cost of TLB misses.

## Comprehensive Summary

**Page Table Size Problem**: Linear page tables consume excessive memory in modern systems (4MB per process for a 32-bit system).

**Solutions Explored**:

1. **Bigger Pages**
   - *Pros*: Reduces table size by factor equal to page size increase.
   - *Cons*: Causes internal fragmentation; waste within each large page.

2. **Hybrid Approach (Paging + Segmentation)**
   - *How it works*: One page table per logical segment, tracked via base/bounds registers.
   - *Pros*: Eliminates wasted entries between segments.
   - *Cons*: Requires segmentation (not flexible), causes external fragmentation.

3. **Multi-level Page Tables** (*Most Effective*)
   - *Core Idea*: Hierarchical structure where only used portions of the page table are allocated.
   - *Structure*:
     - Top level: Page directory
     - Middle levels: Point to pages of the next level
     - Bottom level: Actual PTEs (Page Table Entries)
   - *Trade-off*: Two memory accesses on TLB miss vs. one for linear tables.

4. **Inverted Page Tables**
   - *Core Idea*: Single global table mapping physical frames to virtual addresses.
   - *Implementation*: Hash table over the base structure for fast lookup.

5. **Swapping Page Tables to Disk**
   - Allows moving page tables between memory and disk when needed, relaxing assumptions about their fixed location in kernel memory.

> 💡 *Key Insight from Slide 10*: "The savings for large (32-bit or 64-bit) address spaces could obviously be much greater."
