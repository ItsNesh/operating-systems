Okay, I need to create comprehensive study notes based on a textbook chapter about hard disk drives. The user has provided all the slides from Week 7 of their operating systems course. Let me analyze this carefully.

First, I notice this is for an OS class focusing on storage devices - specifically HDDs (hard disk drives). The material covers everything from basic geometry to scheduling algorithms. Since it's a textbook chapter with detailed content including examples and formulas, my notes need to be extremely thorough.

Hmm... the user emphasized "DETAILED" study notes covering ALL content. That means I can't skip anything - not even those small footnotes about dimensional analysis or that slide on track skew. Every concept must be extracted and explained properly.

Let me mentally organize this by section:
- The interface (Slide 1)
- Basic geometry terms like platters, tracks etc. (Slides 2-3)
- Latency components: rotational delay, seek time (Slides 3-4)
- I/O timing math with formulas (Slide 6-8)
- Disk scheduling algorithms (SSTF, SCAN variants) (Slides 10-12)
- The "unwritten contract" concept (Slide 2)

I should watch out for tricky parts like:
- That dimensional analysis example in Slide 6 - need to explain it step-by-step
- Why average seek time is ~1/3 of full seek (Slide 9's math)
- The difference between SSTF and SPTF scheduling

The references at the end are important too - I'll include those as "Further Reading" but not in main notes since they're just citations.

For structure, I'm thinking:
# Hierarchical headers for each major section
**Bold key terms** like "rotational delay"
Tables comparing disk specs (like Cheetah vs Barracuda)
All formulas with explanations

The user wants 15-20 study questions at the end - that's crucial. Not just simple recall but application questions testing deep understanding, like "Why does track skew exist?" or "When would SATF outperform SSTF?"

*checking slide count again*
Slide 16 has homework problems... I should convert those into practice questions rather than listing them verbatim.

Biggest challenge will be making the physics of disk operation clear without getting too technical. For example, explaining why outer tracks have more sectors (geometry) but not diving into magnetic properties.

Also must clarify common confusions:
- "Block" vs "sector" terminology
- Why write-back caching is dangerous for file systems
- How rotational delay differs from seek time

*noticing the slide about SSDs in references*
Important to note this chapter focuses on HDDs, though it mentions SSD research. Shouldn't include that in notes since not covered.

For examples:
- The 3-track diagram (Slide 4) needs detailed walkthrough
- Must explain Figure 37.8 showing SSTF's limitation

*checking slide 12*
Ah! That "IT ALWAYS DEPENDS" tip is gold - should emphasize it as a key engineering principle beyond just disks.

Okay, time to structure this systematically starting from the interface definition through all components...

# Comprehensive Study Notes: Hard Disk Drives (Week 7)

---

## **I. Core Concepts & Interface**

### **1. Fundamental Interface**
- **Disk as an Array of Sectors**:  
  Modern HDDs store data in fixed-size blocks called *sectors* (typically **512 bytes**). Each sector has a unique address from `0` to `n−1` on a disk with `n` sectors.
  - **Atomicity Guarantee**: Manufacturers guarantee that a single 512-byte write is atomic (completes entirely or not at all). Larger writes may suffer *torn writes* during power loss.

- **The "Unwritten Contract"** ([SG04]):  
  Assumptions clients make but aren’t part of the interface:
  - Accessing nearby blocks (`block` and `sector` used interchangeably) is faster than distant ones.
  - Sequential access (contiguous blocks) is significantly faster than random access.

---

## **II. Physical Geometry & Components**

### **1. Key Terminology**
| Term          | Definition                                                                 |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Platter**   | Circular hard surface coated with magnetic layer for persistent storage.    |
| **Surface**   | One side of a platter (each platter has 2 surfaces).                       |
| **Spindle**   | Central axis to which all platters are attached; spins at fixed RPM rate.   |
| **Track**     | Concentric circle on a surface where data is stored.                        |
| **Disk Head** | Reads/writes magnetic patterns (one per surface); mounted on disk arm.      |
| **Disk Arm**  | Moves head across tracks to position over desired track.                    |

### **2. Geometry Details**
- **RPM & Rotation Time**:  
  - Typical modern HDDs: **7,200–15,000 RPM**.
  - *Example*: 10,000 RPM → rotation time = `60 seconds / 10,000 rotations` = **6 ms/rotation**.
- **Track Density**:  
  Tracks are tightly packed (hundreds fit in a human hair’s width). Outer tracks have more sectors than inner tracks due to geometry (**multi-zoned drives**).
- **Track Skew**:  
  Sectors on adjacent tracks are offset by `2 blocks` (e.g., Figure 37.4) to avoid waiting for the next sector during track switches.

### **3. Physical Operation Diagrams**
- **Single Track Example** (Figure 37.1 & 37.2):  
  - Disk rotates counter-clockwise; head positioned over sector `6`.
  - *Rotational delay*: Time to wait for desired sector under head (`R/2` on average).
    > *Example*: To access sector `0` from position `6`, worst-case rotation = **full rotation** (if starting at `5`).

- **Multi-Track Example** (Figure 37.3):  
  - Head moves to outer track via *seek* → waits for rotational delay (`~3 sectors`) → transfers data.
  - **Seek phases**: Acceleration → coasting → deceleration → settling (**0.5–2 ms settling time**).

## **III. I/O Performance Components**

### **1. I/O Time Formula**
$$T_{I/O} = T_{\text{seek}} + T_{\text{rotation}} + T_{\text{transfer}} \quad (37.1)$$

| Component          | Description                                                                 | Typical Value       |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| **Seek Time**      | Time to move head to correct track (`T_seek`).                               | 4–9 ms              |
| **Rotational Delay** | Average time for sector to rotate under head (`R/2` where `R = rotation period`). | 1–2 ms (at 7,500 RPM) |
| **Transfer Time**   | Data transfer rate from disk surface.                                       | ~30 μs per 4KB block |

### **2. I/O Rate Formula**
$$R_{I/O} = \frac{\text{Size}_{\text{transfer}}}{T_{I/O}} \quad (37.2)$$

---

## **IV. Performance Analysis: Random vs. Sequential Workloads**

### **1. Case Study: Cheetah 15K.5 vs. Barracuda**
| Parameter          | Cheetah 15K.5 (SCSI)       | Barracuda (SATA)         |
|--------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------|
| Capacity           | 300 GB                     | 1 TB                     |
| RPM                | 15,000                     | 7,200                    |
| Avg. Seek Time     | **4 ms**                   | **9 ms**                 |
| Max Transfer Rate  | 125 MB/s                   | 105 MB/s                 |

### **2. Random Workload Calculation (4KB reads)**
- *Cheetah*:  
  $T_{I/O} = \underbrace{4\text{ms}}_{\text{seek}} + \underbrace{2\text{ms}}_{\text{rotation}} + \underbrace{0.03\text{ms}}_{\text{transfer}} = \mathbf{6\ ms}$  
  $R_{I/O} = \frac{4\text{KB}}{6\text{ms}} = \mathbf{0.66\ MB/s}$
- *Barracuda*:  
  $T_{I/O} = 9 + 2 + 0.03 = \mathbf{11.03\ ms}$ → **$R_{I/O} = 0.31\ MB/s$**

### **3. Sequential Workload Calculation (100MB transfer)**
- *Cheetah*: $T_{I/O} ≈ 4 + 2 + \frac{100,000}{125,000} = \mathbf{800\ ms}$ → **$R_{I/O} ≈ 125\ MB/s$**
- *Barracuda*: $T_{I/O} ≈ 9 + 2 + \frac{100,000}{105,000} = \mathbf{950\ ms}$ → **$R_{I/O} ≈ 105\ MB/s$**

### **4. Key Insight: Random vs. Sequential Performance Gap**
| Drive       | Random I/O Rate | Sequential I/O Rate | Ratio (Seq/Random) |
|-------------|-----------------|---------------------|--------------------|
| Cheetah     | 0.66 MB/s       | 125 MB/s            | **~190×**          |
| Barracuda   | 0.31 MB/s       | 105 MB/s            | **~340×**          |

> 💡 **Design Principle**: *Always transfer data sequentially or in large chunks* (Slide 8 tip).

---

## **V. Disk Scheduling Algorithms**

### **1. Shortest Seek Time First (SSTF)**
- **Mechanism**: Service requests on the nearest track first.
- **Example** (Figure 37.7):  
  Head at inner track → Requests for sectors `21` (middle) and `2` (outer). SSTF services `21` before `2`.
- **Problem: Starvation**  
  If constant requests arrive on the current track, distant tracks are ignored forever.

### **2. Elevator Algorithm (SCAN/C-SCAN)**
| Type       | Mechanism                                                                 |
|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **SCAN**   | Head moves back-and-forth across disk; services all pending requests in order during a sweep. |
| **C-SCAN** | Circular scan: Moves from outer to inner, then resets at outer track (more fair). |

> ⚠️ *Why SCAN avoids starvation*: Late arrivals on distant tracks are queued until the next sweep.

### **3. Shortest Positioning Time First (SPTF/SATF)**
- **Mechanism**: Considers both seek time AND rotational delay (`T_seek + T_rotation`).
  - *When to use SPTF?* When seek and rotation times are comparable.
    > 💡 *"It always depends"* (**Livny’s Law** – Slide 13).

- **Example Failure of SSTF** (Figure 37.8):  
  Head at inner track (`sector 30`). Requests: `sector 16` (middle) vs. `sector 8` (outer).  
  - *SSTF*: Chooses closer middle track → waits for full rotation to access sector `16`.  
  - *SPTF*: Prefers outer track if seek time is low relative to rotational delay.

### **4. Modern Disk Scheduling**
- **Internal vs. OS Scheduler**:  
  | Approach          | How It Works                                                                 |
  |-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | Older Systems     | OS handles all scheduling (simple disks).                                   |
  | Modern Systems    | Disk controller has internal scheduler (implements SPTF using exact head position). |
- **I/O Merging**: Combine adjacent requests into single I/O to reduce overhead.
- **Anticipatory Scheduling** ([ID01]):  
  *Non-work-conserving*: Wait briefly for better incoming requests → improves efficiency.

---

## **VI. Critical Concepts & Formulas**

### **1. Average Seek Time Derivation**
$$\text{Average seek distance} = \frac{\text{Full seek distance}}{3}$$
- **Why?**  
  For tracks `0` to `N`, average absolute difference between any two tracks is $\frac{1}{3}N$ (calculated via double integral, Slide 9).

### **2. Dimensional Analysis Examples**
| Problem                                      | Calculation                                                                 |
|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| *Rotation time for 15K RPM*                  | $ \frac{60\text{s}}{15,\!000} = 4\text{ms/rotation}$                      |
| *Transfer time for 4KB at 125 MB/s*          | $\frac{4\text{KB}}{125,000\text{KB/s}} \times 1000 = \mathbf{32\ μs}$     |

---

## **VII. Summary of Key Insights**

| Concept                          | Why It Matters                                                                 |
|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Unwritten Contract**           | Sequential access > random; nearby blocks faster → drives optimized for this.   |
| **Rotational Delay Dominance**   | At 7,200 RPM: `R = 8.3 ms` → avg. delay = `4.15 ms`; dominates small I/Os.    |
| **SPTF vs. SSTF**                | SPTF better when seek time ≈ rotation (modern drives); hard to implement in OS.|
| **Multi-Zoned Drives**           | Outer tracks have more sectors → higher data density at edges.                 |
| **Write-Back Caching Risk**      | Data may not be written to disk immediately; can cause corruption without journaling. |
