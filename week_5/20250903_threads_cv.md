# Condition Variables: Comprehensive Study Notes

## Introduction and Motivation for Condition Variables

### The Fundamental Problem
Condition variables are synchronization primitives needed **beyond locks** in concurrent programming. While locks prevent multiple threads from accessing shared data simultaneously (ensuring mutual exclusion), they don't address cases where a thread needs to wait until some condition becomes true before proceeding.

The textbook illustrates this with the classic **parent-child threading problem**, where:
- A parent thread creates and waits for a child thread
- The desired output should be: `parent: begin`, then `child`, then `parent: end`

### Inefficient Spin-Based Approach (Figure 30.2)
```c
volatile int done = 0;

void*child(void *arg) {
    printf("child\n");
    done = 1;
    return NULL;
}

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    printf("parent: begin\n");
    pthread_t c;
    Pthread_create(&c, NULL, child, NULL);
    while (done == 0); // Spin-wait
    printf("parent: end\n");
    return 0;
}
```

**Why this is problematic**: 
- **Wastes CPU cycles** through busy waiting ("spinning")
- Inefficient as the thread continuously checks a condition without yielding to other threads

## Core Concepts of Condition Variables

### Definition and Basic Operations
A **condition variable (CV)** is an explicit queue that:
1. Allows threads to put themselves on when some state isn't desired
2. Enables another thread to wake waiting threads after changing said state

**POSIX API for condition variables:**
```c
pthread_cond_wait(pthread_cond_t *cond, pthread_mutex_t *mutex);
pthread_cond_signal(pthread_cond_t *cond);
```

### Critical Mechanics of `wait()`
- **Requires a locked mutex**: The calling thread must hold the lock when invoking wait()
- **Atomic behavior**:
  - Releases the lock and puts the caller to sleep
  - When waking, re-acquires the lock before returning

This atomicity prevents race conditions during waiting.

### Why Mutex is Required with `wait()`
The textbook explains: "It assumes that this mutex is locked when wait() is called. The responsibility of wait() is to release the lock and put the calling thread to sleep (atomically); when the thread wakes up, it must re-acquire the lock before returning."

## Correct Implementation for Parent/Child Example

### Working Solution (Figure 30.3)
```c
int done = 0;
pthread_mutex_t m = PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER;
pthread_cond_t c = PTHREAD_COND_INITIALIZER;

void thr_exit() {
    pthread_mutex_lock(&m);
    done = 1;
    pthread_cond_signal(&c); // Wake parent if waiting
    pthread_mutex_unlock(&m);
}

void*child(void *arg) {
    printf("child\n");
    thr_exit();
    return NULL;
}

void thr_join() {
    pthread_mutex_lock(&m);
    while (done == 0)
        pthread_cond_wait(&c, &m); // Wait with lock held
    pthread_mutex_unlock(&m);
}

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    printf("parent: begin\n");
    pthread_t p;
    pthread_create(&p, NULL, child, NULL);
    thr_join();
    printf("parent: end\n");
    return 0;
}
```

### Execution Scenarios
1. **Parent creates and immediately waits**:
   - Parent acquires lock → checks `done` (false) → calls wait() 
   - Releases lock, goes to sleep
   - Child runs → sets `done=1`, signals condition variable
   - Parent wakes up with lock held → unlocks → prints "parent: end"

2. **Child completes before parent waits**:
   - Child sets `done=1` and signals (no one waiting)
   - Parent acquires lock, sees `done==1`, skips wait

### Why Use a While Loop Instead of If?
```c
// Correct approach with while loop
while (done == 0) 
    pthread_cond_wait(&c, &m);

// Incorrect if statement would be:
if (done == 0)
    pthread_cond_wait(&c, &m);
```

**Reason**: Due to **Mesa semantics**, when a thread wakes up from `wait()`, the condition might no longer hold due to other threads changing state. The while loop re-checks before proceeding.

## Common Mistakes with Condition Variables

### Missing State Variable (Figure 30.4)
```c
void thr_exit() {
    pthread_mutex_lock(&m);
    pthread_cond_signal(&c); // No done variable!
    pthread_mutex_unlock(&m);
}

void thr_join() {
    pthread_mutex_lock(&m);
    pthread_cond_wait(&c, &m);
    pthread_mutex_unlock(&m);
}
```

**Problem**: If child runs immediately and signals before parent waits:
- Child calls `signal()` (no one waiting)
- Parent later tries to wait → gets stuck forever

### Incorrect Lock Usage (Figure 30.5)
```c
void thr_exit() {
    done = 1;
    pthread_cond_signal(&c); // No lock held!
}

void thr_join() {
    if (done == 0)
        pthread_cond_wait(&c);
}
```

**Race Condition**: 
- Parent checks `done==0` → sees true, prepares to wait
- Before calling `wait()`, parent is interrupted by child
- Child sets `done=1`, signals condition variable
- No thread waiting (so no wake-up)
- Parent goes to sleep forever

## The Producer/Consumer Problem (Bounded Buffer)

### Introduction and Real-World Context
The **producer/consumer problem** involves:
- Multiple producer threads generating data items into a buffer
- Multiple consumer threads removing items from the buffer for processing

This is fundamental in systems like:
1. Web servers: Producers put HTTP requests in work queue; consumers process them.
2. UNIX pipes (e.g., `grep foo file.txt | wc -l`):
   - `grep`: Producer writes to pipe
   - `wc`: Consumer reads from pipe
   - Pipe acts as bounded buffer

### Initial Implementation with Single-Entry Buffer
```c
int buffer;
int count = 0; // Initially empty (count=0)

void put(int value) {
    assert(count == 0); // Must be empty to write
    count = 1;
    buffer = value;
}

int get() {
    assert(count == 1); // Must be full to read
    count = 0;
    return buffer;
}
```

### Broken Solution: One Condition Variable + If Statements (Figure 30.8)
```c
// Producer thread:
Pthread_mutex_lock(&mutex);
if (count == 1) 
    Pthread_cond_wait(&cond, &mutex); // Wait for empty buffer
put(i);
Pthread_cond_signal(&cond);
Pthread_mutex_unlock(&mutex);

// Consumer thread:
Pthread_mutex_lock(&mutex);
if (count == 0)
    Pthread_cond_wait(&cond, &mutex); // Wait for full buffer
int tmp = get();
Pthread_cond_signal(&cond);
Pthread_mutex_unlock(&mutex);
```

**Why it fails with multiple consumers**: 
- If two consumers wait and a producer fills the buffer:
  - Producer signals one consumer (say Tc1)
  - Before Tc1 runs, second consumer (Tc2) consumes data
  - When Tc1 wakes up, tries to consume from empty buffer → assertion fails

### Thread Trace Analysis: Broken Solution (Figure 30.9)

| Time | Tc1 State | Tc2 State | Tp State | Count | Comment |
|------|-----------|-----------|----------|-------|---------|
| c1   | Run       | Ready     | Ready    | 0     |         |
| c2   | Run       | Ready     | Ready    | 0     |         |
| c3   | Sleep     | Ready     | Ready    | 0     | Nothing to get |
| p1   | Sleep     | Ready     | Run      | 0     | Producer acquires lock |
| p2   | Sleep     | Ready     | Run      | 0     | Buffer not full → proceed |
| p4   | Sleep     | Ready     | Run      | 1     | Buffer now full |
| c3   | Sleep     | Ready     | Run      | 1     | Tc1 awoken (but still sleeping) |
| ...  |           |           |          |       |         |
| c4   | Run       | Ready     | Ready    | 0     | Tc2 grabs data |

**Critical issue**: When thread wakes up, condition might no longer hold.

### Corrected Solution: While Loops Instead of If (Figure 30.10)
```c
// Producer:
while (count == 1) 
    pthread_cond_wait(&cond, &mutex);
put(i);
pthread_cond_signal(&cond);

// Consumer:
while (count == 0)
    pthread_cond_wait(&cond, &mutex);
int tmp = get();
pthread_cond_signal(&cond);
```

**Why it works**: After waking from `wait()`, thread re-checks condition with lock held. If buffer is empty when Tc1 wakes up, it goes back to sleep.

### Second Problem: Single Condition Variable Still Fails (Figure 30.11)
Even with while loops:
- Two consumers wait on same CV
- Producer fills buffer and signals one consumer (Tc1)
- Consumer Tc1 consumes data → then signals the condition variable
- **Problem**: The signal might wake another consumer instead of producer

**Thread Trace Analysis: Broken Solution (v2)**
| Time | Tc1 State | Tc2 State | Tp State | Count | Comment |
|------|-----------|-----------|----------|-------|---------|
| c3   | Sleep     | Sleep     | Ready    | 0     | Both consumers asleep |
| p4   | Sleep     | Sleep     | Run      | 1     | Producer fills buffer |
| Tc1 awoken (p5) |         |           |          |       |         |
| c2   | Run       | Sleep     | Ready    | 1     | Rechecks condition → full, consumes data |
| p3   | Sleep     | Sleep     | Run      | 0     | Producer tries to fill again (buffer empty) |

**Critical issue**: Consumer signals the same CV that producer waits on. When consumer Tc1 wakes up and signals:
- It might wake another consumer instead of producer
- Both consumers go back to sleep, leaving producer asleep → all threads stuck

### Correct Solution: Two Condition Variables (Figure 30.12)
```c
cond_t empty, fill; // Separate CVs for different conditions
mutex_t mutex;

void*producer(void *arg) {
    Pthread_mutex_lock(&mutex);
    while (count == MAX) 
        pthread_cond_wait(&empty, &mutex); // Wait until buffer not full
    put(i);
    pthread_cond_signal(&fill); // Signal consumers that data is available
    Pthread_mutex_unlock(&mutex);
}

void*consumer(void *arg) {
    Pthread_mutex_lock(&mutex);
    while (count == 0)
        pthread_cond_wait(&fill, &mutex); // Wait until buffer not empty
    int tmp = get();
    pthread_cond_signal(&empty); // Signal producers that space is available
    Pthread_mutex_unlock(&mutex);
}
```

**Why it works**: 
- Producers wait on `empty` condition (buffer full)
- Consumers wait on `fill` condition (buffer empty)
- Signaling only wakes threads waiting for the correct state

## Advanced Concepts: Mesa vs Hoare Semantics and Covering Conditions

### Mesa vs Hoare Semantics
| **Mesa Semantics** | **Hoare Semantics** |
|--------------------|---------------------|
| When signaled, thread is placed in ready queue (not immediately runs) | Woken thread runs immediately after signaling |
| Most systems use this model (e.g., POSIX threads) | Harder to implement correctly; rarely used |

**Why Mesa semantics matter**: 
- After waking from `wait()`, the condition might no longer hold
- **Always re-check conditions with while loops**, not if statements

### Covering Conditions: Memory Allocation Example (Figure 30.15)
```c
int bytesLeft = MAX_HEAP_SIZE;
cond_t c;
mutex_t m;

void* allocate(int size) {
    pthread_mutex_lock(&m);
    while (bytesLeft < size)
        pthread_cond_wait(&c, &m); // Wait until enough memory free
    void *ptr = ...; // Get mem from heap
    bytesLeft -= size;
    pthread_mutex_unlock(&m);
    return ptr;
}

void free(void *ptr, int size) {
    pthread_mutex_lock(&m);
    bytesLeft += size;
    pthread_cond_signal(&c); // Problem: Might wake wrong thread!
    pthread_mutex_unlock(&m);
}
```

**Problem**: 
- Thread A requests 100 bytes
- Thread B requests 10 bytes (both wait)
- Thread C frees 50 bytes → signals condition variable

**Issue**: The signal might wake the thread waiting for 100 bytes instead of 10, causing it to proceed with insufficient memory.

### Solution: Use `pthread_cond_broadcast()`
```c
void free(void *ptr, int size) {
    pthread_mutex_lock(&m);
    bytesLeft += size;
    pthread_cond_broadcast(&c); // Wake all waiting threads!
    pthread_mutex_unlock(&m);
}
```

**Why it works**: 
- Broadcast wakes **all** waiting threads (not just one)
- Each thread re-checks condition with while loop
- Only the correct thread proceeds; others go back to sleep

### When to Use `broadcast()` vs `signal()`
| **Use broadcast (`pthread_cond_broadcast`)** | **Use signal (`pthread_cond_signal`)** |
|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| For "covering conditions" (e.g., memory allocation) where any waiting thread might be satisfied | For cases with clear, specific signaling needs (like producer/consumer with two CVs) |
| When it's impossible to know which exact thread should wake up | When you can precisely determine the correct threads to wake |

## Best Practices for Condition Variables

### Critical Rules
1. **Always hold lock when calling `wait()` or `signal()`:**
   - This is required by semantics of `wait()`
   - Prevents race conditions (as shown in Figure 30.5)

2. **Use while loops, not if statements:**
   ```c
   // ALWAYS use:
   while (condition) 
       pthread_cond_wait(...);
   
   // NEVER do this:
   if (condition)
       pthread_cond_wait(...); // Can lead to race conditions!
   ```

3. **Re-check condition after waking up:**
   - Due to Mesa semantics, the state might have changed
   - While loop ensures thread only proceeds when condition is met

4. **Use separate CVs for different states (e.g., empty/full):**
   - Prevents accidental wake-up of wrong threads
   - Solves producer/consumer problem with multiple producers/consumers

### Why Spurious Wakeups Occur
- Some implementations may wake a thread without any signal being sent
- **Always use while loops to handle spurious wakeups**

## Summary: Critical Takeaways for Exams and Deep Learning

| Concept | Key Insight |
|---------|-------------|
| Condition Variable Purpose | Allows threads to wait until some condition becomes true (beyond simple locks) |
| `wait()` Mechanics | Must hold lock; releases it atomically when sleeping, re-acquires before returning |
| While Loop Requirement | **Mandatory** due to Mesa semantics and spurious wakeups |
| Single CV Limitation | Cannot distinguish between different waiting conditions → leads to incorrect thread waking |
| Two-CV Solution | Producers wait on `empty`, consumers wait on `fill` (solves producer/consumer problem) |
| Broadcast vs Signal | Use broadcast for covering conditions; use signal when you can precisely determine which threads should wake |
