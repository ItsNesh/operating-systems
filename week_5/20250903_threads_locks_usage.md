# Comprehensive Study Notes: Threads Locks Usage (Week 5)

## Introduction to Lock-Based Concurrent Data Structures

### Core Concept: Thread Safety and the CRUX Question
**Thread safety**: A data structure is thread-safe when it can be safely accessed by multiple threads concurrently without causing race conditions, inconsistent states, or other concurrency issues.

**CRUX of lock-based concurrent structures**: *How do we add locks to a data structure in order to make it work correctly while enabling high performance (allowing many threads to access the structure at once)?*

This is the central challenge when designing concurrent data structures. The textbook emphasizes that:
- Correctness must be ensured first
- Performance optimization should only occur if needed ("*if your data structure is not too slow, you are done!*")
- There's a fundamental tension between correctness and performance

**Key Principle**: *Avoid premature optimization*. As Donald Knuth famously stated: "*Premature optimization is the root of all evil.*" Start with simple solutions (single lock), then optimize only if needed.

---

## Section 1: Concurrent Counters

### Basic Counter Implementation
#### Non-Concurrent Counter (Figure 29.1)
```c
typedef struct __counter_t {
    int value;
} counter_t;

void init(counter_t *c) { c->value = 0; }
void increment(counter_t *c) { c->value++; }
void decrement(counter_t *c) { c->value--; }
int get(counter_t *c) { return c->value; }
```

**Explanation**: This is a trivial implementation with no concurrency protection. It will fail in multi-threaded environments due to **race conditions** (multiple threads reading/writing the same value simultaneously).

#### Synchronized Counter with Single Lock (Figure 29.2)
```c
typedef struct __counter_t {
    int value;
    pthread_mutex_t lock;
} counter_t;

void init(counter_t *c) {
    c->value = 0;
    Pthread_mutex_init(&c->lock, NULL);
}

void increment(counter_t *c) {
    Pthread_mutex_lock(&c->lock);
    c->value++;
    Pthread_mutex_unlock(&c->lock);
}
// (decrement and get follow similar pattern)
```

**Explanation**: This implementation adds a single lock to protect all operations. It follows the **monitor design pattern**, where locks are acquired when entering methods that manipulate data structures, and released upon exiting.

### Performance Analysis of Single Lock Approach

#### Benchmark Results (Figure 29.5):
| Threads | Time for 1M Updates |
|---------|---------------------|
| 1       | ~0.03 seconds      |
| 2       | >5 seconds         |
| 4       | Much worse than 2   |

**Key Insight**: The single-lock counter exhibits **poor scalability** because all threads must contend for the same lock, causing significant contention and serialization.

#### Perfect Scaling Concept
- *Perfect scaling*: When adding more processors increases total work done proportionally without increasing time (i.e., linear speedup).
- Single-lock counters fail to achieve perfect scaling due to high contention on a single resource.

---

### Approximate Counters for Scalability

#### Core Idea [C06]
Approximate counters solve the scalability problem by:
1. Using **local physical counters** per CPU core
2. Maintaining a **single global counter**
3. Periodically transferring local values to the global counter (using a threshold `S`)

#### Implementation Details (Figure 29.4):
```c
typedef struct __counter_t {
    int global; // Global count
    pthread_mutex_t glock; // Global lock
    int local[NUMCPUS]; // Per-CPU counts
    pthread_mutex_t llock[NUMCPUS]; // Locks for each local counter
    int threshold; // Update frequency (threshold S)
} counter_t;

void init(counter_t *c, int threshold) {
    c->threshold = threshold;
    c->global = 0;
    Pthread_mutex_init(&c->glock, NULL);
    for (int i = 0; i < NUMCPUS; i++) {
        c->local[i] = 0;
        pthread_mutex_init(&c->llock[i], NULL);
    }
}

void update(counter_t *c, int threadID, int amt) {
    int cpu = threadID % NUMCPUS;
    Pthread_mutex_lock(&c->llock[cpu]);
    c->local[cpu] += amt;
    if (c->local[cpu] >= c->threshold) {
        pthread_mutex_lock(&c->glock);
        c->global += c->local[cpu];
        pthread_mutex_unlock(&c->glock);
        c->local[cpu] = 0;
    }
    Pthread_mutex_unlock(&c->llock[cpu]);
}

int get(counter_t *c) {
    int val;
    pthread_mutex_lock(&c->glock);
    val = c->global;
    pthread_mutex_unlock(&c->glock);
    return val; // Approximate value
}
```

#### Example Tracing (Figure 29.3):
| Time | L1 | L2 | L3 | L4 | G |
|------|----|----|----|----|---|
| 0    | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0 |
| 1    | 0  | 0  | 1  | 1  | 0 |
| 2    | 1  | 0  | 2  | 1  | 0 |
| ...  | ...|... |... |... |...|
| 5    | 4  | 1  | 3  | 3  | 0 |
| 6    | 5→0| 1  | 3  | 4  | 5 (from L1) |
| 7    | 0  | 2  | 4  | 5 →0 | 10 (from L4) |

**Explanation**: Each CPU core has its own local counter. When a local counter reaches the threshold `S` (set to 5 in this example), it transfers its value to the global counter and resets itself.

#### Performance Analysis with Thresholds (Figure 29.6):
| Approximation Factor S | Time for 4M Updates on 4 CPUs |
|------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Low (e.g., S=1)        | Poor performance              |
| Medium                 | Good balance                  |
| High (e.g., S=1024)    | Excellent scaling             |

**Key Trade-off**: 
- **Small `S`**: More accurate global count, but poor scalability
- **Large `S`**: Better scalability, but larger potential error in the global value

The maximum possible error is at most `(number of CPUs × S)`.

## Section 2: Concurrent Linked Lists

### Basic Implementation with Single Lock (Figure 29.7)
```c
typedef struct __node_t {
    int key;
    struct __node_t *next;
} node_t;

typedef struct __list_t {
    node_t *head;
    pthread_mutex_t lock;
} list_t;

void List_Init(list_t *L) { /* ... */ }

int List_Insert(list_t *L, int key) {
    Pthread_mutex_lock(&L->lock);
    node_t*new = malloc(sizeof(node_t));
    if (new == NULL) {
        perror("malloc");
        pthread_mutex_unlock(&L->lock);
        return -1;
    }
    new->key = key;
    new->next = L->head;
    L->head = new;
    Pthread_mutex_unlock(&L->lock);
    return 0;
}

int List_Lookup(list_t *L, int key) {
    // Similar structure with lock acquisition/release
}
```

**Critical Issue**: The error handling path (when `malloc()` fails) requires releasing the lock before returning. This creates **error-prone code paths**, as shown by a study finding that nearly 40% of Linux kernel bugs occur in rarely-taken control flow paths.

### Improved Implementation with Better Control Flow (Figure 29.8)
```c
int List_Insert(list_t *L, int key) {
    node_t*new = malloc(sizeof(node_t));
    if (new == NULL) { 
        perror("malloc");
        return -1;
    }
    new->key = key;
    
    pthread_mutex_lock(&L->lock);
    new->next = L->head;
    L->head = new;
    pthread_mutex_unlock(&L->lock);
    return 0;
}

int List_Lookup(list_t *L, int key) {
    int rv = -1;
    pthread_mutex_lock(&L->lock);
    node_t*curr = L->head;
    while (curr) {
        if (curr->key == key) {
            rv = 0;
            break;
        }
        curr = curr->next;
    }
    pthread_mutex_unlock(&L->lock);
    return rv;
}
```

**Key Improvements**:
1. **Reduced lock acquisition points**: Only critical section is locked
2. **Single exit path for lookup**, eliminating multiple unlock paths
3. **Avoids error-prone control flow changes**

---

### Hand-over-Hand Locking (Lock Coupling)

#### Concept [MS04]:
Instead of a single global lock, add one lock per node in the list. When traversing:
1. Acquire next node's lock first
2. Release current node's lock

**Why it was considered**: To enable higher concurrency by allowing multiple threads to traverse different parts of the list simultaneously.

#### Implementation Challenges (from textbook):
- **Overhead is prohibitive**: The cost of acquiring/releasing locks for each node traversal outweighs benefits.
- **Practical limitation**: Even with large lists and many threads, simple single-lock approach often outperforms hand-over-hand locking due to lock overhead.

**Conclusion from text**: "Hand-over-hand locking...is hard to make such a structure faster than the simple single lock approach."

---

## Section 3: Concurrent Queues (Michael & Scott Queue)

### Design Principles
- **Two locks**: One for head, one for tail operations
- **Dummy node**: Added during initialization to separate head and tail operations

#### Implementation Details (Figure 29.9):
```c
typedef struct __queue_t {
    node_t *head;
    node_t *tail;
    pthread_mutex_t head_lock, tail_lock;
} queue_t;

void Queue_Init(queue_t *q) {
    // Initialize dummy node as both head and tail
    node_t*tmp = malloc(sizeof(node_t));
    tmp->next = NULL;
    q->head = q->tail = tmp;
    
    pthread_mutex_init(&q->head_lock, NULL);
    pthread_mutex_init(&q->tail_lock, NULL);
}

void Queue_Enqueue(queue_t *q, int value) {
    node_t*tmp = malloc(sizeof(node_t));
    assert(tmp != NULL);
    tmp->value = value;
    tmp->next = NULL;

    // Only need tail lock for enqueue
    pthread_mutex_lock(&q->tail_lock);
    q->tail->next = tmp;
    q->tail = tmp;
    pthread_mutex_unlock(&q->tail_lock);
}

int Queue_Dequeue(queue_t *q, int*value) {
    // Only need head lock for dequeue
    pthread_mutex_lock(&q->head_lock);
    node_t*tmp = q->head;
    node_t*new_head = tmp->next;
    
    if (new_head == NULL) {  // Queue empty?
        pthread_mutex_unlock(&q->head_lock);
        return -1;
    }
    
    *value = new_head->value;
    q->head = new_head;
    pthread_mutex_unlock(&q->head_lock);
    free(tmp);  // Free dummy node
    return 0;
}
```

**Key Insight**: The two-lock design enables concurrent enqueue and dequeue operations (unlike a single lock that would serialize these).

---

## Section 4: Concurrent Hash Table

### Implementation with Per-Bucket Locking (Figure 29.10)
```c
#define BUCKETS (101)

typedef struct __hash_t {
    list_t lists[BUCKETS]; // Each bucket is a concurrent linked list
} hash_t;

void Hash_Init(hash_t *H) {
    for (int i = 0; i < BUCKETS; i++)
        List_Init(&H->lists[i]);
}

int Hash_Insert(hash_t *H, int key) {
    return List_Insert(&H->lists[key % BUCKETS], key);
}

int Hash_Lookup(hash_t *H, int key) {
    return List_Lookup(&H->lists[key % BUCKETS], key);
}
```

**Why it scales well**: 
- Each bucket has its own lock
- Operations on different buckets can proceed concurrently
- Reduces contention compared to a single global lock

#### Performance Analysis (Figure 29.11):
| Data Structure | Concurrent Updates |
|----------------|--------------------|
| Simple Linked List (single lock) | Poor scaling with increasing threads |
| Hash Table (per-bucket locking) | Excellent scalability |

**Key Insight**: The hash table implementation scales much better because it enables concurrent operations on different buckets.

---

## Section 5: Key Principles for Concurrent Data Structures

### Avoiding Premature Optimization
- **Knuth's Law**: "Premature optimization is the root of all evil."
- **Practical Application**: 
  - Start with simple single-lock implementation (correctness first)
  - Only optimize if performance problems exist
  - *Example*: Linux initially used a Big Kernel Lock (BKL), which was later replaced by finer-grained locking

### Design Tips for Concurrent Code:
1. **Be wary of control flow changes** that lead to function returns/exits with locks held.
2. **Minimize lock acquisition points**: Only hold the lock during critical sections, not around all operations.
3. **Structure code to minimize error paths requiring unlock calls**.

## Final Summary

Lock-based concurrent data structures require careful balancing between correctness and performance. The textbook demonstrates this through several examples:

1. Simple single-lock implementations provide thread safety but suffer from poor scalability due to high contention.
2. Approximate counters solve the scaling problem for counters by using local per-CPU counters with periodic synchronization, trading accuracy for better concurrency.
3. Linked lists can be made concurrent with a single lock (simple) or hand-over-hand locking (theoretically more concurrent), but practical overhead often makes simple approaches preferable.
4. Queues benefit from two locks (head and tail operations).
5. Hash tables achieve excellent scalability through per-bucket locking.

The key principle throughout is: **start simple, measure performance needs before optimizing**. As Knuth stated, "Premature optimization is the root of all evil." This approach has been validated by historical transitions in operating systems like Linux (from BKL to finer-grained locks).

For exam preparation and deep learning, focus on understanding:
- The trade-offs between accuracy/performance
- Why simple implementations often outperform complex ones due to reduced overhead
- How different locking strategies affect scalability for various data structures
