# Comprehensive Study Notes: Introduction to Operating Systems (Week 1)

---

## **Core Concepts of Operating Systems**

### **The Von Neumann Model**
*   The fundamental model describing how computers execute programs
*   A running program executes instructions sequentially:
    *   Fetch instruction from memory
    *   Decode the instruction (determine what operation it performs)
    *   Execute the instruction (perform the action, e.g., add numbers, access memory)
*   Modern processors optimize this process with techniques like out-of-order execution and parallelism, but programs assume sequential execution

### **The Operating System: Definition & Purpose**
*   The body of software responsible for making computer systems easy to use
*   Primary functions:
    *   Virtualizing physical resources (CPU, memory, disk)
    *   Managing system resources efficiently
    *   Providing interfaces/APIs for applications to interact with hardware

### **Virtualization: Core Concept**
*   Transforming a physical resource into a more general, powerful, and easy-to-use virtual form
*   The OS acts as a "virtual machine" by providing:
    *   A seemingly infinite number of CPUs (via CPU virtualization)
    *   Private memory spaces for each process (memory virtualization)
    *   Persistent storage that survives system reboots

> **The Crux of the Problem: How to Virtualize Resources**  
> This is the central question we'll address throughout this book. The OS must transform physical resources into more usable forms while managing them efficiently.

---

## **Key Operating System Abstractions**

### **1. CPU Virtualization**
*   Turning a single processor (or small set) into seemingly infinite CPUs
*   Allows multiple programs to run as if they have their own dedicated processors

#### *Example: Running Multiple Programs Simultaneously*
```c
// cpu.c - Simple program that loops and prints strings
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <sys/time.h>
#include <assert.h>
#include "common.h"

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    if (argc != 2) {
        fprintf(stderr, "usage: cpu <string>\n");
        exit(1);
    }
    char*str = argv[1];
    while (1) {
        Spin(1); // Wait for one second
        printf("%s\n", str);
    }
    return 0;
}
```

**Execution Example:**
```bash
prompt> gcc -o cpu cpu.c -Wall
prompt> ./cpu "A"
A
A
A
...
^C (to terminate)
```

When running multiple instances:
```bash
prompt> ./cpu A & ./cpu B & ./cpu C & ./cpu D &
[1] 7353
[2] 7354
[3] 7355
[4] 7356
A
B
D
C
A
...
```

**Key Insight:**  
*Even with a single CPU, the OS creates an illusion that multiple programs are running simultaneously through rapid context switching.*

---

### **2. Memory Virtualization**
*   Providing each process with its own private virtual address space (memory)
*   Physical memory is shared among processes but appears isolated to each program

#### *Example: Multiple Processes Accessing Memory*
```c
// mem.c - Program that allocates and accesses memory
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include "common.h"

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    int*p = malloc(sizeof(int)); // Allocate memory
    assert(p != NULL);
    printf("(%d) address pointed to by p: %p\n", getpid(), p); 
    *p = 0; // Initialize allocated memory
    
    while (1) {
        Spin(1);
        *p =*p + 1;
        printf("(%d) p: %d\n", getpid(), *p);
    }
    return 0;
}
```

**Execution Example with Multiple Instances:**
```bash
prompt> ./mem & ./mem &
[1] 24113
[2] 24114
(24113) address pointed to by p: 0x200000
(24114) address pointed to by p: 0x200000
(24113) p: 1
(24114) p: 1
...
```

**Key Insight:**  
*Each process appears to have its own memory at the same physical address (0x200000), but they're actually isolated from each other. This is achieved through virtual addressing and page tables.*

---

### **3. Concurrency**
*   The challenge of managing multiple activities happening simultaneously within a single program or across programs
*   Key problem: Ensuring correct behavior when shared resources are accessed by concurrent entities

#### *Example: Multi-threaded Program with Race Condition*
```c
// threads.c - Multi-threaded counter increment example
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include "common.h"
#include "common_threads.h"

volatile int counter = 0;
int loops;

void*worker(void *arg) {
    int i;
    for (i = 0; i < loops; i++) {
        counter++;
    }
    return NULL;
}

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    if (argc != 2) {
        fprintf(stderr, "usage: threads <value>\n");
        exit(1);
    }
    loops = atoi(argv[1]);
    
    pthread_t p1, p2;
    printf("Initial value : %d\n", counter);
    
    Pthread_create(&p1, NULL, worker, NULL);
    Pthread_create(&p2, NULL, worker, NULL);
    
    Pthread_join(p1, NULL);
    Pthread_join(p2, NULL);
    
    printf("Final value : %d\n", counter);
    return 0;
}
```

**Expected vs. Actual Results:**
```bash
prompt> ./threads 1000
Initial value : 0
Final value : 2000

# When loops = 100,000:
prompt> ./threads 100000
Initial value : 0
Final value : 143012 // Not the expected 200,000!
```

**Why This Happens:**  
*The increment operation (`counter++`) requires three instructions:*
1. *Load counter from memory into register*
2. *Increment the register*
3. *Store result back to memory*

*These steps are not atomic (they don't happen all at once), so when multiple threads execute them concurrently, they can interfere with each other.*

> **The Crux of the Problem: How to Build Correct Concurrent Programs**  
> When many concurrent threads access shared data in the same address space, how do we ensure correct program behavior? What primitives and mechanisms are needed?

---

### **4. Persistence**
*   The ability to store data reliably across system reboots or power failures
*   Critical because volatile memory (like DRAM) loses all data when powered off

#### *Example: File I/O Operations*
```c
// io.c - Program that creates a file with "hello world"
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <assert.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <sys/types.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    int fd = open("/tmp/file",
                  O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC,
                  S_IRWXU);
    
    assert(fd > -1);
    int rc = write(fd, "hello world\n", 13);
    assert(rc == 13);
    close(fd);
    return 0;
}
```

**Key System Calls:**
*   `open()`: Creates or opens a file
*   `write()`: Writes data to the open file
*   `close()`: Closes the file

> **The Crux of the Problem: How to Store Data Persistently**  
> The OS must manage persistent storage correctly despite hardware failures, crashes, and performance constraints.

## **Operating System Design Goals**

| Goal | Explanation |
|------|-------------|
| **Abstraction** | Creating simplified interfaces that hide complexity (e.g., `open()` hides disk access details) |
| **High Performance** | Minimizing OS overheads in terms of time and memory usage |
| **Protection/Isolation** | Ensuring processes can't interfere with each other or the OS itself |
| **Reliability** | Operating systems must run continuously without failure (when they fail, all applications fail) |

### *Why Protection Matters*
*   Without protection:
    *   A malicious application could access any file on disk
    *   An error in one program could crash the entire system
    *   Memory corruption from one process would affect others

---

## **Operating System History**

### **Early Operating Systems: Just Libraries**
- Basic libraries of commonly-used functions (e.g., I/O routines)
- One program ran at a time, controlled by human operators
- Known as "batch processing" because jobs were run in batches by an operator
- Computers weren't used interactively due to high cost

### **Beyond Libraries: Protection & System Calls**
*   Introduction of system calls (vs. library functions):
    *   Special hardware instructions and privilege levels for transitions between user mode and kernel mode
    *   User applications run in "user mode" with restricted access
    *   When a system call is made, the processor switches to "kernel mode"
        - Hardware raises privilege level during transition
        - OS handles request in full-access mode
        - Returns control back to application after completion

### **The Era of Multiprogramming**
*   Enabled by minicomputers (e.g., PDP family) becoming affordable
*   Key innovation: Running multiple programs simultaneously, switching between them rapidly
*   Benefits:
    *   Better CPU utilization (while one program waits for I/O)
    *   More efficient use of system resources

### **The UNIX Revolution**
*   Developed at Bell Labs by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie
*   Borrowed ideas from Multics but simplified the design
*   Key principles:
    *   Small, powerful programs that can be combined (pipes: `grep foo file.txt|wc -l`)
    *   Friendly environment for programmers with C compiler

#### **The Importance of UNIX**
- Influenced all modern operating systems
- Pioneered concepts like pipes and the shell
- Made programming easier through a consistent interface
- Early open-source distribution model (free code sharing)

### **Linux: The Modern Successor to UNIX**
*   Created by Linus Torvalds in 1991 as an alternative to UNIX
*   Borrowed principles but not source code, avoiding legal issues
*   Leveraged GNU tools and became the foundation for modern open-source systems

> *The computing gods should be thanked that Linux exists today. It powers most of our cloud infrastructure (Google, Amazon, Facebook), smartphones (Android), and even Apple's macOS.*

## **System Architecture: User Mode vs Kernel Mode**

| Feature | User Mode | Kernel Mode |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| **Privilege Level** | Low privilege level | High privilege level |
| **Access to Hardware** | Restricted access | Full hardware access (I/O, memory management) |
| **Typical Operations** | Application execution | System calls, device drivers |
| **Failure Impact** | Only affects the application | Can crash entire system |

### *How a System Call Works*
1. User program executes `syscall` instruction
2. Hardware transfers control to OS trap handler (raises privilege level)
3. OS performs requested operation in kernel mode
4. OS returns from trap, lowers privilege level back to user mode

---

## **Summary of Key Concepts**

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Virtualization** | Transforming physical resources into more usable virtual forms |
| **Resource Manager** | The OS manages CPU, memory, and disk as shared system resources |
| **Abstraction** | Hiding complexity through simplified interfaces (e.g., `open()` instead of direct hardware access) |
| **Concurrency** | Managing multiple activities happening simultaneously; requires careful synchronization |
| **Persistence** | Storing data reliably across reboots using file systems on disks/SSDs |
| **Protection** | Isolating processes from each other to prevent interference or malicious behavior |

2. Virtualizing CPU allows multiple programs to run seemingly simultaneously on a single processor.
3. Memory virtualization provides each process with its own private address space, even though they share the same physical memory.
4. Concurrency problems arise when shared data is accessed by multiple threads without proper synchronization (race conditions).
5. Persistence ensures that user data survives system reboots and crashes through file systems on disks/SSDs.
6. The OS provides protection between applications using isolation mechanisms, preventing one program from interfering with others or the OS itself.
7. System calls are how applications request services from the operating system; they involve a hardware transition to kernel mode.
8. UNIX's influence is pervasive in modern computing due to its design principles and open-source nature (leading to Linux).
9. The key historical shift was moving from batch processing with one program at a time, to multiprogramming where multiple programs run concurrently.
